 told deputies Sunny and 
were inside the residence in the bedroom. For 
full 
statement, see Deputy Koble's attached report. 
 
Deputies entered the residence to detain Sunny. Sunny was inside the residence in the bedroom with 
 clung to his right hip. Deputies gave Sunny commands to surrender. Sunny refused to comply with 
commands and began to resist deputies all while 
was by his side, unnecessarily placing 
 
into potential danger. A use of force ensued, and deputies were able to successfully detain Sunny. (Refer 
to Corporal Spinelli and Deputy Carey's use of force report for further details). Deputy Carey sustained a 
minor abrasion and swelling to his right hand, along with a complaint of pain.  
 
Sunny sustained injuries to his face and right arm during the use of force. Medics were called to the 
location to assess Sunny's injuries. While waiting for medics, I performed a search of Sunny's person 
incident to arrest. Inside Sunny's left front pocket, I located a small baggy of a white powdery substance 
and a separate small baggy containing a brown tar-like substance. I collected both baggies as evidence. 
Sunny had no weapons or any other paraphernalia on his person. 
 
AMR #254 arrived on scene and transported Sunny to Sharp Memorial Hospital. Corporal McCarthy 
(#0301) rode in the ambulance with Sunny and remained with him at the hospital. At the hospital, it was 
determined Sunny sustained a fractured right arm during the use of force. The Division of Inspectional 
Services (DIS) was notified and responded to the incident. 
 
Corporal Mejia, Corporal Spinelli, Deputy Carey, Deputy Koble, and I returned to apartment #15 to 
search for further contraband and firearms. A search of the residence yielded negative results. Deputies 
were made aware Sunny's 2023 Buick (
 was on the property. 
gave Deputy Cutler 
consent to search the vehicle. Deputy Koble performed a search of the vehicle which yielded negative 
results. 
 
I contacted Judge Alejandro Morales who granted the EPO which is set to expire on 04/06/2024 and lists 
both 
and 
 as protected persons and Sunny as the restrained person. I provided 
 
with a copy of the EPO, explaining to her what it entails and the process on how to extend it if needed. I 
provided 
with a domestic violence resource guide with the assigned case number. 
 
I went to Sharp Memorial Hospital and met with Sunny. I read Sunny the Miranda Admonishment 
verbatim utilizing my department issued Deputy's notebook. Sunny understood his rights and was willing 
to provide a statement. Sunny provided the following summarized statement. For the full statement, refer 
to my body worn camera footage. 
 
STATEMENT OF Sunny Estrada (Arrestee): 
 
At approximately 0700 hours, 
woke up Sunny because she was going through his phone and 
found messages between Sunny and another woman. Sunny became upset because he believed 
was ""looking for problems.""

 wanted to leave the residence, but Sunny did not want her to 
leave because it was cold and raining outside and 
was wearing very little clothing. 
 
lunged at Sunny and slapped him. Sunny decided to leave the residence to ""get some fresh air"" and de-
escalate the situation. 
 
Sunny returned to the residence and 
had already begun packing Sunny's belongings into trash 
bags. Sunny told 
 he wanted to

Sunny returned to the apartment to retrieve

he deactivated her mobile phone. 
 returned to the residence to get her phone reactivated and 
Sunny asked to see her phone. 
 refused to allow Sunny to access her phone, so Sunny allowed 
her to view his phone. She began to get upset again so Sunny grabbed 
and went back to 
 
apartment. 
 
Shortly after Deputies arrived, 
 informed Sunny that police were there but was unsure as to what 
they were there for. Sunny reactivated 
 phone and began messaging her and her 
. 
Sunny then went into 
bedroom to try and lay 
down for a nap. Deputies entered the 
residence and Sunny was startled. Sunny ""went into defense mode"" and ""wanted to protect 
."" 
Sunny was not attempting to fight or resist Deputies. 
 
Sunny did not know about the drugs and just ""threw on some pants to leave the house."" Sunny did not 
own the magazine or rounds of ammunition or know how they got into his residence. Since last April, 
many people have been in and out of 
 residence and it could have belonged to any of them.

inside of her left forearm, and a bruise on the back of her left triceps. I took photographs of 
and 
her injuries which I later submitted into evidence at the Rancho San Diego Patrol Station. 
 
I went over to apartment #15, the location of the incident. I knocked on the door, announced myself as 
San Diego Sheriff's Department, and instructed Sunny to open the door and come talk to me. Several 
attempts to contact Sunny were unsuccessful, and deputies extrapolated a plan to gain access to the 
residence. 
 
Corporal Spinelli was able to contact the property manager and through consent of 
 gave us 
the key to the residence. Corporal Mejia made one final announcement, then Corporal Mejia, Corporal 
Spinelli, Deputy Carey (#0761), and I made entry into the residence. After clearing the residence, 
deputies noticed a loaded AR-style magazine on the floor in the kitchen of the residence but were unable 
to locate Sunny or 
 
 
In fear of 
 being missing, we contacted 
again to locate 
.

 While I gathered information 
from 
 Sergeant Harrison (#2799), Corporal Spinelli, Deputy Carey, and Deputy Koble (#4270) 
went to 
 to see if 
 was there. 
 
 told deputies Sunny and 
were inside the residence in the bedroom. For 
 full 
statement, see Deputy Koble's attached report. 
 
Deputies entered the residence to detain Sunny. Sunny was inside the residence in the bedroom with 
 clung to his right hip. Deputies gave Sunny commands to surrender. Sunny refused to comply with 
commands and began to resist deputies all while 
was by his side, unnecessarily placing 
 
into potential danger. A use of force ensued, and deputies were able to successfully detain Sunny. (Refer 
to Corporal Spinelli and Deputy Carey's use of force report for further details). Deputy Carey sustained a 
minor abrasion and swelling to his right hand, along with a complaint of pain.  
 
Sunny sustained injuries to his face and right arm during the use of force. Medics were called to the 
location to assess Sunny's injuries. While waiting for medics, I performed a search of Sunny's person 
incident to arrest. Inside Sunny's left front pocket, I located a small baggy of a white powdery substance 
and a separate small baggy containing a brown tar-like substance. I collected both baggies as evidence. 
Sunny had no weapons or any other paraphernalia on his person. 
 
AMR #254 arrived on scene and transported Sunny to Sharp Memorial Hospital. Corporal McCarthy 
(#0301) rode in the ambulance with Sunny and remained with him at the hospital. At the hospital, it was 
determined Sunny sustained a fractured right arm during the use of force. The Division of Inspectional 
Services (DIS) was notified and responded to the incident. 
 
Corporal Mejia, Corporal Spinelli, Deputy Carey, Deputy Koble, and I returned to apartment #15 to 
search for further contraband and firearms. A search of the residence yielded negative results. Deputies

 was on the property. 
 gave Deputy Cutler 
consent to search the vehicle. Deputy Koble performed a search of the vehicle which yielded negative 
results. 
 
I contacted Judge Alejandro Morales who granted the EPO which is set to expire on 04/06/2024 and lists 
both 
 and 
 as protected persons and Sunny as the restrained person. I provided
 
with a copy of the EPO, explaining to her what it entails and the process on how to extend it if needed. I 
provided 
 with a domestic violence resource guide with the assigned case number. 
 
I went to Sharp Memorial Hospital and met with Sunny. I read Sunny the Miranda Admonishment 
verbatim utilizing my department issued Deputy's notebook. Sunny understood his rights and was willing 
to provide a statement. Sunny provided the following summarized statement. For the full statement, refer 
to my body worn camera footage. 
 
STATEMENT OF Sunny Estrada (Arrestee): 
 
At approximately 0700 hours, 
woke up Sunny because she was going through his phone and 
found messages between Sunny and another woman. Sunny became upset because he believed 
 was ""looking for problems."" 
 became more and more agitated as the conversation 
continued and began yelling. 
 wanted to leave the residence, but Sunny did not want her to 
leave because it was cold and raining outside and 
was wearing very little clothing. 
 
lunged at Sunny and slapped him. Sunny decided to leave the residence to ""get some fresh air"" and de-
escalate the situation. 
 
Sunny returned to the residence and 
 had already begun packing Sunny's belongings into trash 
bags. Sunny told 
 he wanted to 
 and took 
over to 
 
 
  
 
Sunny returned to the apartment to retrieve 
 to change 
 and 
 was gone. In spite, 
he deactivated her mobile phone. 
 returned to the residence to get her phone reactivated and 
Sunny asked to see her phone. 
refused to allow Sunny to access her phone, so Sunny allowed 
her to view his phone. She began to get upset again so Sunny grabbed 
 and went back to 
 
apartment. 
 
Shortly after Deputies arrived, 
informed Sunny that police were there but was unsure as to what 
they were there for. Sunny reactivated 
 phone and began messaging her and her 
. 
Sunny then went into 
 bedroom to try and lay 
 down for a nap. Deputies entered the 
residence and Sunny was startled. Sunny ""went into defense mode"" and ""wanted to protect 
 
Sunny was not attempting to fight or resist Deputies.

Sunny did not know about the drugs and just ""threw on some pants to leave the house."" Sunny did not 
own the magazine or rounds of ammunition or know how they got into his residence. Since last April, 
many people have been in and out of 
 residence and it could have belonged to any of them.

and 32310 (c) - PC - POSSESS LARGE CAPACITY MAGAZINE (M). 
 
I served Sunny with a copy of the EPO and explained it's contents. I placed a copy of the EPO in his 
property bag. I released Sunny to the custody of San Diego Central Jail Deputies at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital to be booked at a later time. I took photographs of Sunny and his injuries which I later submitted 
into evidence at the Rancho San Diego Patrol Station. 
 
I completed an emergency referral and e-mailed a copy to Child Protective Services. 
 
A PAT-28 DV Supplemental Form was filled out and attached to the case file. 
 
A TruNarc presumptive test of the white crystalline substance found in Sunny's pocket tested positive for 
the presence of cocaine with a total gross weight of 1.14 grams. The total gross weight of the brown tar-

REPORT NARRATIVE

ORIGIN:

 

On 03/30/24, at approximately 1151 hours, | responded to a radio call of a domestic violence incident at 8914 Troy St, in the
unincorporated area of Spring Valley, County of San Diego (CAD #E9144930).

DEPUTY'S ACTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS:

 
  

Deputy Daoust #0239 and | arrived on scene and met with ((e){(ayt oe
(SE and determined there was probable cause to detain (((aIt=} Sunny Estrada for 273.5(a) PC - SPOUSAL

ABUSE and 236 PC - FALSE IMRPISONMENT (See Deputy Daoust's arrest report for further) (@QEPE believed Estrada

was still inside of apartment with (()](aT(=)) (b)(6)(B) The apartment she provided was #15.

We made multiple attempts outside of apartment #15 for Estrada to exit the residence peacefully with no response. | was able
to obtain a key from the property manager which we utilized to gain entry and confirmed Estrada was not inside of that
apartment. While inside of apartment #15, a high-capacity magazine with 29 unspent rifle rounds was located on the kitchen
floor.

Deputy Daoust and | returned to apartment to speak to[{]@yEpand try to locate}, fearing that Estrada may have
fled with ji . (GEN provided information that Estrada did possibly posses an unknown firearm and she did not know

where it would be stored. She shared that they sometimes bring BQ) to GGT) (b)(6)(B)

| contacted who @IGIEp He gave me consent to search jj apartment for the GED | asked
IOS) if Estrada was inside the residence, and he pointed to the closed bedroom door. This led me to believe Estrada may be
inside of the room, so | requested cover partners to respond to my location. Deputy Carey #0761 opened the door and
observed Estrada standing behind the bed with (9) directly next to him. Deputy Carey gave Estrada instructions to show
him his hands which Estrada refused to comply with. | observed Estrada reach his hands into his pockets, causing me to
believe he may be reaching for the firearm that had not been located. Fearing for the safety of | decided to
holster my department issued Glock 17 and approach Estrada alongside Deputy Carey. Estrada continued to refuse to comply
with Deputy Carey's directions. Deputy Carey grabbed onto Estrada while | picked up the (GE). GIGI and moved
onto the bed so jj would not be injured. A use of force ensued (See Deputy Carey's officer report for details).

After Deputy Carey was able to take down Estrada onto the bed, I grabbed his head and pinned it against the bed. I grabbed 
his left wrist and also pinned it against the bed while we attempted to position Estrada onto his back to be safely handcuffed. 
Estrada started pulling his arms away and continued to try to reach into his pockets. Fearing Estrada may have a firearm or 
other deadly weapon, I continued to pull Estrada's arms away from his body. Due to the small space where we were pinned in 
between the bed and the wall, and Estrada's refusal to comply, it was difficult to position Estrada onto his stomach to be 
handcuffed. I feared that if Estrada was not handcuffed, he could injure myself or others. I delivered two closed fist strikes to 
Estrada's face to try to gain compliance. Estrada began to yell in pain, and we were able to safely detain him in handcuffs 
after approximately a minute. My initial force was not effective, causing additional force to be used. My strikes to Estrada's 
face caused swelling to his facial area. Estrada was transported to Sharp Memorial for treatment, where it was later 
determined he sustained a broken arm during the use of force. No Deputies were injured due to my use of force. Had I not 
used force, Estrada could have continued to resist Deputy Carey and caused serious bodily injury to myself or others. 
 
Corporal Mejia #3849 and Deputy Daoust took photographs of the scene and Estrada. My body worn camera was utilized 
during the incident.

#15 in Spring Valley (CAD#E9144930).

DEPUTYS OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

| arrived at the above listed address as deputies had already established a perimeter around the residence and had been
attempting to call Estrada out of the residence. Estrada refused to comply with instruction and would not communicate with
deputies or come out of the residence.

Deputies obtained a key from the property manager to access the apartment where Estrada was believed to be hiding.
Deputies made announcements into the apartment for Estrada to come out with his hands in the air holding nothing in his
hands. After making several announcements into the residence and receiving no reply deputies entered the residence. After
entering the residence deputies discovered the apartment was unoccupied and Estrada had left the scene with his (QE
J) Deputies located a loaded AR-15 rifle magazine on the kitchen floor of the apartment. Based on this finding |

verbal commands however when I knocked on the door it unintentionally swung open. When the door opened, I saw Estrada 
standing in the bedroom with both hands-on 
shoulder as he stood behind him.  
 
I pointed my Glock 17 9mm at Estrada and began giving verbal commands for him to put his hands in the air. Estrada refused 
to comply and ignored my commands. I feared Estrada may attempt to use 
 as a barrier to prevent deputies from 
detaining him thus putting 
at risk for great bodily injury. Additionally, I was unsure if Estrada was in possession of any 
weapons. I believed the safest option to gain control over the situation was to immediately intervene and physically detain 
Estrada in handcuffs while my partners maintained lethal coverage.  
 
I holstered my department issued Glock 19 9mm and approached Estrada. I grasped Estrada by both his left and right wrists 
and began placing his arms in a position to be handcuffed. Estrada began pulling away from my grasp to escape detention. I 
instructed Estrada to ""stop moving, stop reaching"" and he refused to comply. Estrada was given numerous commands to stop 
resisting and he replied, ""nah this is bullshit"". I feared if I did not immediately detain Estrada the situation would violently 
escalate. I grasped Estrada by the right arm and pulled him down onto the bed. Estrada continued to resist and pull away from 
my grasp as I made numerous attempts to pull his arms behind his back. Estrada continued to push my hands away from him 
to prevent me from gaining control. Estrada began curling his body in a fetal position while placing his hands under his torso 
towards his waist band.  
 
I feared Estrada was reaching for a weapon to inflict serious injury and prevent me from detaining him in handcuffs. I delivered 
three closed fist strikes impacting Estrada in the face as he continued to resist deputies.  I pulled Estrada's right arm behind 
his back and Deputy Spinelli pulled Estrada's left arm behind his back (See Deputy Spinelli's Officer's Report). As I was 
pulling Estrada to the ground, Deputy Spinelli and I fell from the bed and onto the floor. The action of falling from the bed to 
the floor while Estrada's arm was behind his back caused my entire body weight to collide with Estrada as he hit the ground 
which compressed his arm. Estrada began shouting that his arm was hurt but continued to resist by kicking his legs and 
flailing his body. I delivered two closed fist strikes impacting Estrada in the face.  
 
Estrada stopped resisting and I rolled him onto his stomach in a prone position. I straddled Estrada's torso in a mounted 
position. I pulled Estrada's right and left arm behind his back and secured him in handcuffs. Deputy Spinelli and I assisted 
Estrada to a standing position and escorted him out of the residence.  
 
San Miguel Fire Department Paramedics arrived on scene and transported Estrada to Sharp Memorial Hospital for further 
treatment. Hospital staff determined Estrada sustained a fracture on his right arm as a result of the of force. I sustained pain, 
swelling and an abrasion on my right hand as a result of the use of force.  
 
The force I used was effective and necessary to detain Estrada as he displayed escalating assaultive behavior and continued 
to resist deputies. Had I not used force Estrada would have continued to resist possibly injuring a deputy on scene and 
endangering the safety of

BACKGROUND: 
 
Maradiaga, Jose (BN 24707521) is currently in custody for 
 
 
 
INVESTIGATION: 
 
Upon arrival to the 2nd Floor elevator well, I observed Deputy Valenzuela, Deputy Ordonez #2545, 
Deputy McAnany #4060, and Corporal Uson #3452 physically struggling with an incarcerated person 
later identified as Maradiaga, Jose (BN24707521) on the floor of Elevator 3.  It appeared each deputy 
was trying to gain control of Maradiaga as he physically thrashing his body around causing the deputies 
to use controlling force. I was later informed that Deputy Valenzuela had to utilize closed fist strikes to 
gain compliance as well as in self defense. For more information, please reference Deputy Valenzuela, 
Deputy Ordonez, Corporal Uson, and Deputy McAnany's Officer Reports. 
 
As I arrived and assessed where I could assist, Corporal Wanzer also arrived on scene and instructed 
the deputies involved to remove Maradiaga from the elevator.  In response, I grabbed Maradiaga's right 
arm with both of my hands and, with a pulling motion, pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator with the 
assistance of the other involved deputies. 
 
Once out of Elevator #3 and in the incarcerated person well on his stomach, Maradiaga continued to 
resist by thrashing about and tensing his body. While maintaining grip on Maradiaga's right arm, Corporal 
Wanzer took control of Maradiaga's right arm, allowing me to apply downward pressure on Maradiaga's 
upper back region to suppress his efforts of thrashing about. Corporal Wanzer then guided Maradiaga's 
right hand towards me, allowing me to place both of his hands in handcuffs because Maradiaga's left 
hand was now also behind his back. With Maradiaga now in handcuffs, another deputy was able to 
secure Maradiaga in leg chains. Had I not used force, we would not have been able to place Maradiaga 
in restraints.  
 
Once Maradiaga was placed into handcuffs and leg chains, deputies lifted him onto the gurney, and was 
secured to the gurney via the affixed gurney straps.  Maradiaga was then escorted to the 2nd Floor Strip 
Search room and medically evaluated by Nurse 
.  Nurse 
 treated 
Maradiaga's injuries and cleared him to be housed.  Deputy Getnet #4549 took photos of all visible 
injuries that Maradiaga sustained. 
 
Sgt. Applebaum #3075 took photos of Deputy Valenzuela's visible injuries before Deputy Valenzuela 
went to the hospital for treatment. Deputy Crist #3604 from Classification arrived on scene shortly after 
and interviewed Maradiaga and determined he would be housed on the 5th Floor with a classification 
code of level 5. Deputy Crist also informed me that Maradiaga would now be dressed in Dayglow Green 
Clothing to indicate his assaultive status.

Once Maradiaga was done being medically and mentally assessed, he was removed from the gurney.  
Due to the previous use of force and assaultive behavior, Maradiaga remained in leg chains and 
handcuffs as I utilized sheers to remove his clothing.  Maradiaga was placed into Dayglow Green Jail 
Clothing as an indication of his assaultive behavior.  Maradiaga was then secured back onto the gurney 
and escorted to the 5th Floor. 
 
Once on the 5th Floor, Maradiaga was removed from the gurney and placed on the floor of 5D 
. 
Corporal Wanzer, Deputy McAnany, Deputy Ordonez, Deputy Delgado, and I entered the cell with 
Maradiaga to safely remove his restraints. As I removed the handcuffs from Maradiaga's left wrist, 
Corporal Wanzer attempted to guide Maradiaga's left hand under his stomach and ordered him not to 
move. Deputy Delgado then entered the cell to articulate the orders in Spanish to help Maradiaga 
understand the orders better. However, despite the instructions given to Maradiaga, he disobeyed the 
order and attempted to free his hand from under his stomach. To suppress Maradiaga's efforts of 
resistance, I applied downward pressure with both hands to Maradiaga's upper back region. My force 
was effective as Corporal Wanzer was able to secure Maradiaga's left hand under his stomach. 
Maradiaga's handcuffs and leg chains were removed, and all parties safely exited the cell without further 
incident. Had I not pushed Maradiaga's upper back, we would not have been able to exit the cell safely. 
 
In total, Maradiaga was on the gurney for approximately 30 minutes.  Sgt. Cardoza #3223 was the 
designated safety officer for the duration of the gurney escort. 
On 02/25/2024, I went to the 5th Floor and had Deputy Delgado #0186 translate and read Maradiaga's 
Miranda Rights verbatim from a deputy-issued notebook.  Maradiaga responded yes to question number 
one and yes to question number two.  Deputy Delgado asked Maradiaga what happened in the elevator, 
and he essentially said the following. 
 
STATEMENTS: 
 
(Statement of Maradiaga, Jose) 
 
When asked what happened, Maradiaga essentially said he was arguing with the Deputy and that he 
was attacked and didn't do anything wrong.  Deputy Delgado asked him if he had anything relevant to the 
situation he wanted to tell me, but Maradiaga said no. Based on Maradiaga having no other statements 
to add, I ended my conversation with Maradiaga. 
 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUED: 
 
On 2/25/2024, I was informed that Deputy Valenzuela sustained abrasions to both knees, redness to his 
face, swelling on his right pinky finger, and a scratch to his left shoulder region. I also called the 3rd Floor 
Clinics area. I was informed by Nurse Practitioner 
 that Maradiaga sustained a deviated nasal 
septum and bruising to his left eye and went to the hospital for treatment. Maradiaga returned from the 
hospital and was placed back in 5D 
. Based on the above information, Maradiaga will be charged with

area sustained during the use of force.  CCTV footage, photos, and Body Worn Camera (BWC) footage 
are available.  Deputy Valenzuela does desire prosecution for 69 PC (A) Obstruct/ Resist Executive 
Officer with Serious Injury and 243 PC (C)(2) Battery On a Peace Or Police Officer. 
 
ORIGIN: 
 
On 02/24/24, I was assigned to work the 2nd Floor Search Medical Screening Deputy position at the San 
Diego Central Jail (SDCJ). At approximately 1545 hours, I heard traffic over the radio there was an active 
use of force involving a deputy and an IP inside the elevator on the 2nd Floor.  I immediately ran to the 
elevator well to assist. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
Maradiaga, Jose (BN 24707521) is currently in custody for 
 
 
 
INVESTIGATION: 
 
Upon arrival to the 2nd Floor elevator well, I observed Deputy Valenzuela, Deputy Ordonez #2545, 
Deputy McAnany #4060, and Corporal Uson #3452 physically struggling with an incarcerated person 
later identified as Maradiaga, Jose (BN24707521) on the floor of Elevator 3.  It appeared each deputy 
was trying to gain control of Maradiaga as he physically thrashing his body around causing the deputies 
to use controlling force. I was later informed that Deputy Valenzuela had to utilize closed fist strikes to 
gain compliance as well as in self defense. For more information, please reference Deputy Valenzuela, 
Deputy Ordonez, Corporal Uson, and Deputy McAnany's Officer Reports. 
 
As I arrived and assessed where I could assist, Corporal Wanzer also arrived on scene and instructed 
the deputies involved to remove Maradiaga from the elevator.  In response, I grabbed Maradiaga's right 
arm with both of my hands and, with a pulling motion, pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator with the 
assistance of the other involved deputies. 
 
Once out of Elevator #3 and in the incarcerated person well on his stomach, Maradiaga continued to 
resist by thrashing about and tensing his body. While maintaining grip on Maradiaga's right arm, Corporal 
Wanzer took control of Maradiaga's right arm, allowing me to apply downward pressure on Maradiaga's 
upper back region to suppress his efforts of thrashing about. Corporal Wanzer then guided Maradiaga's 
right hand towards me, allowing me to place both of his hands in handcuffs because Maradiaga's left 
hand was now also behind his back. With Maradiaga now in handcuffs, another deputy was able to 
secure Maradiaga in leg chains. Had I not used force, we would not have been able to place Maradiaga 
in restraints.  
 
Once Maradiaga was placed into handcuffs and leg chains, deputies lifted him onto the gurney, and was 
secured to the gurney via the affixed gurney straps.  Maradiaga was then escorted to the 2nd Floor Strip 
Search room and medically evaluated by Nurse 
.  Nurse

Maradiaga's injuries and cleared him to be housed.  Deputy Getnet #4549 took photos of all visible 
injuries that Maradiaga sustained. 
 
Sgt. Applebaum #3075 took photos of Deputy Valenzuela's visible injuries before Deputy Valenzuela 
went to the hospital for treatment. Deputy Crist #3604 from Classification arrived on scene shortly after 
and interviewed Maradiaga and determined he would be housed on the 5th Floor with a classification 
code of level 5. Deputy Crist also informed me that Maradiaga would now be dressed in Dayglow Green 
Clothing to indicate his assaultive status. 
 
  
Once Maradiaga was done being medically and mentally assessed, he was removed from the gurney.  
Due to the previous use of force and assaultive behavior, Maradiaga remained in leg chains and 
handcuffs as I utilized sheers to remove his clothing.  Maradiaga was placed into Dayglow Green Jail 
Clothing as an indication of his assaultive behavior.  Maradiaga was then secured back onto the gurney 
and escorted to the 5th Floor. 
 
Once on the 5th Floor, Maradiaga was removed from the gurney and placed on the floor of 5D 
. 
Corporal Wanzer, Deputy McAnany, Deputy Ordonez, Deputy Delgado, and I entered the cell with 
Maradiaga to safely remove his restraints. As I removed the handcuffs from Maradiaga's left wrist, 
Corporal Wanzer attempted to guide Maradiaga's left hand under his stomach and ordered him not to 
move. Deputy Delgado then entered the cell to articulate the orders in Spanish to help Maradiaga 
understand the orders better. However, despite the instructions given to Maradiaga, he disobeyed the 
order and attempted to free his hand from under his stomach. To suppress Maradiaga's efforts of 
resistance, I applied downward pressure with both hands to Maradiaga's upper back region. My force 
was effective as Corporal Wanzer was able to secure Maradiaga's left hand under his stomach. 
Maradiaga's handcuffs and leg chains were removed, and all parties safely exited the cell without further 
incident. Had I not pushed Maradiaga's upper back, we would not have been able to exit the cell safely. 
 
In total, Maradiaga was on the gurney for approximately 30 minutes.  Sgt. Cardoza #3223 was the 
designated safety officer for the duration of the gurney escort. 
On 02/25/2024, I went to the 5th Floor and had Deputy Delgado #0186 translate and read Maradiaga's 
Miranda Rights verbatim from a deputy-issued notebook.  Maradiaga responded yes to question number 
one and yes to question number two.  Deputy Delgado asked Maradiaga what happened in the elevator, 
and he essentially said the following. 
 
STATEMENTS: 
 
(Statement of Maradiaga, Jose) 
 
When asked what happened, Maradiaga essentially said he was arguing with the Deputy and that he 
was attacked and didn't do anything wrong.  Deputy Delgado asked him if he had anything relevant to the 
situation he wanted to tell me, but Maradiaga said no. Based on Maradiaga having no other statements 
to add, I ended my conversation with Maradiaga.

was taken, got his shirt cut off, and then taken away. 
 
I asked Maradiaga if he had fought back. He told me he did not because he respects the police. I asked him again if, while in 
the elevator, he turned toward the deputy. Maradiaga told me he was facing the wall when he was grabbed and hit. I asked 
him to tell me how he reacted to that. Maradiaga said he did nothing and only asked why he was being grabbed. Maradiaga 
said he did not do anything and did not hit the deputy. I asked Maradiaga if he had any questions for me. He told me he did 
not and that everything was okay. I concluded my interview with Maradiaga, and he was escorted back to his assigned cell.

Call for Service # E9081221

ORIGIN:

On 2/24/2024, at about 1545 hours, | was assigned to work the Search Deputy position at the San Diego Central Jail (SDC4J).
At about 1555 Hours, | heard a call on the facility radio that indicated a fight might be occurring in the elevator well on the 2nd
Floor.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

| entered the elevator well and observed other deputies struggling to control a person inside the open elevator, later identified
as Maradiaga, Jose #24707521. | noticed that Maradiaga's right arm was uncontrolled and tucked under his body so that
deputies could not control it. | was concerned that he might strike or grab other deputies with the hand as they attempted to
control him. | grabbed his right wrist with both of my hands and pulled it away from his body. | then pushed it towards the
small of his back so that he could be handcuffed. My initial force was ineffective, and he continued to struggle with his hands
unsecured in handcuffs.

Cpl. Wanzer #3363 suggested that Maradiaga be moved from the confines of the elevator towards the 2nd Floor elevator well
so that additional deputies could assist in controlling him. He was pulled out of the elevator by other deputies. | let go of his
right wrist when Cpl. Wanzer took control of the wrist. Maradiaga was prone on the elevator well floor at this time.

| noticed that other deputies were controlling Maradiaga's hands/wrists, but he was not handcuffed because he was resisting.
He was tense, and | was concerned he would attempt to stand up. | used both hands to push down on his head to ensure he
did not stand up. | maintained the downward pressure on his head until both of his hands were secured in handcuffs, and his
feet were both secured in a leg chain. Had | not used force, we would not have been able to control Maradiaga and placed
him in restraints.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

Case # 24107659
Event# E9081221

ORIGIN:

On 2/24/2024, at about 1545 hours, | was assigned to the Final / Book and Release Deputy position at the San Diego Central
Jail (SDCJ) when | heard on the facility radio of a use of force occurring in elevator #3 on the 2nd Floor.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

| approached the elevator and saw Deputies Valenzuela #0641 and Ordonez #2545 on the elevator floor, attempting to gain
control of a person later identified as Jose Maradiaga BN24707521. | entered the elevator and tried to gain control of
Maradiaga's upper right torso and head. Deputy Valenzuela moved to where | was attempting to gain access to control
Maradiaga, so | assessed and saw that Maradiaga's legs were not secured and moved to that area.

| moved around Deputy Valenzuela and attempted to gain control of Maradiaga's right leg. As | reached for his right leg, he
pulled his legs up towards his torso. Deputy Getnet #4549 arrived and assisted in controlling Maradiaga. | reached up and
pulled Maradiaga's right foot with my right hand. This force was effective as it prevented Maradiaga from kicking. He would
have kicked one of us if | had not pulled his leg.

I heard Corporal Wanzer #3363 direct us to move Maradiaga from the elevator to the 2nd Floor elevator staging area so that 
additional deputies could assist in controlling him.  I told Deputy Getnet to grab Maradiaga's right leg to assist in moving him 
out of the elevator. I released Maradiaga's right foot as he was moved out of the elevator. 
 
I had no further contact.

him up from his legs with the other deputies and putting him outside the elevator. Once outside the elevator, | used both

Maradiaga was handcuffed, and I applied the leg restraints on him and continued controlling his legs until we lifted him and 
placed him on a gurney. The safety officer was Sergeant Cardoza #3223. IP Maradiaga was transported from the IP elevator 
well on the 2nd Floor to the search room via gurney. 
 
In the Search room, Maradiaga was medically evaluated for his minor abrasions to the left eye by Nurse 
 
and treated on the scene. 
 
 IP Maradiaga was then removed from the gurney. I helped by supporting his legs with my hands and we 
placed him prone on the floor. We changed his clothing into jail-issued green clothing. I assisted by removing his pants and 
placing jail-issued green pants on him. I then assisted in placing Maradiaga back onto the gurney by supporting his legs with 
my hands. We escorted him to the 5th Floor via gurney.  We arrived to cell 
 in Module D. Deputies removed him from the 
gurney, and I moved the gurney out of the way. 
 
I had no further contact with IP Maradiaga.

REPORT NARRATIVE

ORIGIN:
On 02/24/2024 at approximately 1545 hours, | was assigned to the Central Command Center (CCC) at the San Diego Central
Jail (SDCJ). | was assisting the 2nd Floor deputies with normal operations.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:
| heard over my facility radio that a ""use of force"" was in progress inside elevator #3 on the 2nd Floor.

| arrived at the 2nd Floor elevator well and witnessed multiple deputies attempting to gain control of an incarcerated person,
later identified as Maradiaga, Jose (24707521). Maradiaga was actively fighting by kicking his legs and swinging his fists. |
instructed the deputies to remove Maradiaga from the elevator into the elevator well to gain control of him better.

| noticed Maradiaga's right hand was not under control and was swinging his fist around. | gained control of Maradiaga's right
arm with both hands and placed his right arm in a shoulder pin technique. This force was effective in stopping Maradiaga from
thrashing his body around. | then placed Maradiaga's right arm behind his back with my hands. Other deputies secured
Maradiaga's wrists in handcuffs. Maradiaga relaxed his body and stopped thrashing around. Had | not pinned Maradiaga's
shoulder and placed his arm behind him, we would not have been able to secure him in restraints.

Maradiaga was assisted onto a medical gurney and escorted to the 2nd Floor Strip Room. Maradiaga was medically
evaluated and cleared to continue the booking process. Maradiaga was (Tare)

who cleared Maradiaga to also continue the booking process. Maradiaga's clothes were cut off and
removed with no incident. Maradiaga was given jail-issued ""day-glo"" green clothing.

Maradiaga was escorted to the 5th Floor Module D Cell 
 via a medical gurney. Maradiaga was assisted off the medical 
gurney and placed in the prone position inside the cell. Maradiaga was given multiple commands to place his hands under his 
stomach when the handcuffs were removed. Once the handcuffs were removed, Maradiaga attempted to stand up. I placed 
my left hand on the left side of Maradiaga's head and applied downward pressure. This force effectively prevented Maradiaga 
from standing up and possibly assaulting one of us. Had I not controlled his head, Maradiaga could have stood back up.  
 
I commanded Maradiaga to remain on the floor until the cell door was secured. All deputies exited the cell with no incident. 
 
I had no further contact with Maradiaga.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

 

ORIGIN:

On 02/24/2024, at approximately 1545 hours, | was assigned to the 2nd Floor CNIT Deputy position at the San Diego Central
Jail (SDCJ) when | was awaiting the elevator to arrive on the 2nd Floor.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

Deputy Valenzuela #0641 was escorting IP Maradiaga, Jose BN 24707521 to the 2nd Floor to continue the booking process
via the elevator. As the elevator arrived on the 2nd Floor, | observed Deputy Valenzuela in a physical altercation with IP
Maradiaga. | saw Maradiaga actively punching Deputy Valenzuela and | immediately responded, striking Maradiaga
approximately 12 times with my left closed fist to his face. | continued to strike Maradiaga because he was actively resisting
us and punching at Deputy Valenzuela. | attempted to gain control of his left arm. | used both hands to bring Maradiaga's arm
towards his back. | gave Maradiaga verbal commands, instructing him to give me his hands. This force was not successful,
and additional force was needed. To gain control of Maradiaga, deputies on scene pulled him out of the elevator and into the
elevator well.

In the elevator well, | placed Maradiaga's left arm onto his back with my hands. Maradiaga actively resisted me by flexing his
arm. | applied a wrist flex on his left wrist with my hands for approximately six seconds and applied downward pressure on
Maradiaga's left arm to keep it under control until handcuffs could be applied. Maradiaga flexed his left arm, and | delivered
two strikes with my left knee to Maradiaga's left side of his body. Handcuffs were subsequently applied to Maradiaga. | used
force to control Maradiaga's arms and secure him in handcuffs. Had | not used force, Maradiaga could have caused great

bodily injury to my partners or me trying to control him.  I assisted Maradiaga onto a medical gurney by lifting his left shoulder. 
Once he was secured onto the gurney, we escorted him to the 2nd Floor Strip Search Room, where he received a medical 
and a Detentions Safety Program evaluation. Maradiaga was cleared for housing. 
 
We escorted Maradiaga to the 5th Floor D Module for housing. Maradiaga was to be placed into cell 
. Maradiaga was 
escorted to the cell via gurney. I assisted Maradiaga off the gurney and onto the cell floor by supporting the feet and ankles 
with my hands. Maradiaga was placed in a prone position. As I attempted to remove the leg chains, Maradiaga began 
thrashing his legs around. I applied downward pressure on Maradiaga's feet with both of my hands. I applied pressure for 
approximately 10 seconds. Maradiaga stopped resisting, and the leg chain was removed. Once the leg chains were removed, 
Maradiaga thrashed his legs. I continued applying downward pressure with my hands until Deputy Weldon #4534 took control 
of the legs. I exited the cell, followed by my partners, and the door was secured. 
 
I had no further contact with Maradiaga.

REPORT NARRATIVE]
ORIGIN:

 

 

On 02/24/2024, | was assigned to the Contraband and Narcotics Interdiction Team (CNIT) Intake Deputy position at the San
Diego Central Jail (SDCJ) when | contacted Incarcerated Person (IP) Maradiaga, Jose BN 24707521.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 1543 hours, | contacted Maradiaga in Transfer Holding #10 on the 1st Floor of SDCJ. Maradiaga needed to
be escorted to the 2nd Floor to continue the booking process. In my prior contacts with Maradiaga during safety checks and
meal servings, Maradiaga was compliant with my instructions. | opened the cell door slightly to evaluate Maradiaga's
compliance. Maradiaga appeared compliant, and | escorted him out of the cell. To maintain control of Maradiaga, | grabbed
hold of Maradiaga's arm and guided him to the 1st Floor IP elevator well.

At approximately 1545 hours, | escorted Maradiaga into Elevator #3. Once inside the elevator, Maradiaga immediately
attempted to turn his body towards me. To prevent Maradiaga from facing me, | pushed Maradiaga into the elevator wall using
both hands on his upper back and arm. The force was ineffective as Maradiaga continued to push himself off the wall and
face me. | gave Maradiaga numerous commands to ""stop,"" which he refused. After Maradiaga continued not to follow my
instructions and attempted to face me, | determined | would place him in handcuffs to control him.

| ordered Maradiaga to put his hands behind his back, but he refused. As | grabbed Maradiaga’'s right arm and attempted to
pull it behind his back, Maradiaga suddenly cocked his right elbow back in my direction to strike me. Simultaneously,
Maradiaga turned his body toward me. Due to Maradiaga's assaultive behavior, utilizing both of my hands to Maradiaga's
upper body, | pulled him and took him to the floor of the elevator.

Maradiaga initially landed on the left side of his body. To gain control of Maradiaga's head, I applied downward pressure with 
both hands to the right side of his face. The force was ineffective as Maradiaga rolled onto his back. As Maradiaga rolled onto 
his back, I immediately felt him strike me with a closed fist, which contacted my face. Simultaneously, I felt Maradiaga attempt 
to wrap his legs around mine. 
While Maradiaga began to assault me, I was in a locked elevator with no immediate assistance from deputies. While in 
motion, the elevator cannot open manually and must be opened by the Central Command Center (CCC). To defend myself 
from Maradiaga's attack, I delivered three (3) closed-fist strikes with my right hand to Maradiaga's face. As I struck Maradiaga, 
he continued to strike me, kick me, and begin to pull the shoulder area of my duty vest towards his body. As he attacked me, I 
felt Maradiaga's fists or elbows contact my face and upper body several times. 
  
Fearing for my safety, being in a locked elevator, Maradiaga retaliating and continuing to strike me, I struck Maradiaga 
approximately eleven (11) additional times with my right fist. At this time, the elevator arrived on the 2nd Floor, and the door 
was opened. Deputy Ordonez #2545 entered the elevator and assisted me (See Deputy Ordonez's Officer Report). Maradiaga 
continued to attempt to assault me by trying to strike me with his fists. Additionally, I observed Maradiaga also attempt to 
assault Deputy Ordonez. 
  
Maradiaga rolled himself onto his right side and continued to ignore numerous orders from deputies to stop resisting. Due to 
Maradiaga's continued assaultive behavior, I delivered a knee strike with my right knee to Maradiaga's buttocks area. The 
force was ineffective as Maradiaga continued to attempt to strike my partners and I. Because of Maradiaga's continued 
assaultive behavior and attempts to injure me, I delivered approximately four (4) additional closed-fist strikes to Maradiaga's 
head area, which were ineffective. 
  
The use of force and attack from Maradiaga occurred inside the elevator. Due to the elevator being a small, confined space, 
Maradiaga was holding onto my duty vest and continuing to attack me; I could not disengage to assess other force options or 
remove myself to transition to a different force option on my duty belt. 
  
Additional deputies arrived on scene and pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator and into the 2nd Floor IP elevator well. Despite 
additional deputies arriving on scene, Maradiaga continued to resist deputies by not following our orders, attempting to grab 
onto deputies, and thrashing his body around. Because of his continued assaultive behavior, I delivered approximately two 
more (2) knee strikes with my right knee to Maradiaga's buttocks. To gain pain compliance from Maradiaga, I applied a bent 
wrist lock to Maradiaga's left hand with my hands. Simultaneously, I applied downward pressure, utilizing my left knee to 
Maradiaga's buttocks. The force was effective as Maradiaga slowly began to comply with instructions. Had we not used force, 
Maradiaga may have continued to assault my partners or me. 
  
Eventually, deputies were able to gain complete control of Maradiaga and place him in handcuffs. Once a medical gurney 
arrived on scene, I supported Maradiaga's legs and assisted him onto the medical gurney. Maradiaga was placed in the prone 
position, and the safety straps were secured. 
  
Once Maradiaga was secured on the medical gurney, I removed myself from the scene to assess my injuries and had no 
further contact with him. 
  
Immediately, I felt pain and observed swelling in my right pinky finger, pain on the side of my right hand, pain and scrapes to 
both of my knees, pain in my face, and burning to my chest area. Due to the injuries I sustained from Maradiaga's attack, I 
was sent to the hospital for treatment. 
  
Body-Worn Camera (BWC) footage of this incident was captured.

ORIGIN: 
 
On 2/23/2024, at 1507 hours, Officer J. Hernandez and I were in full police uniform driving a marked 
police vehicle when we responded to a radio call of an occupied stolen 1995 Chevrolet Silverado pickup 
truck 
 at Meade Ave. and Van Dyke Ave. San Diego.  The victim's 
 of the stolen 
vehicle, 
, spotted the pickup truck driving in the area and called 911.   
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
An unknown suspect(s) stole 
 green 1995 Chevrolet Silverado 
) from 
4500 40th Street, San Diego, between 1600 hours on 2/18/2024 and 1130 hours on 2/20/2024.   
 did not give anyone permission to take or drive his vehicle.  The estimated value of the vehicle 
is $8,000.  There were no witnesses to the crime and no one was is in custody. 
 
INVESTIGATION: 
 
Officer Hernandez and I arrived in the area and observed the pickup truck with a male driver and female 
passenger traveling west bound at 4200 Meade Ave.  We initiated a traffic stop using our emergency 
lights and sirens.  The pickup truck failed to yield and began speeding up.  The pickup turned north on 
42nd St then made a left (west) turn onto Monroe Ave failing to make a full and complete stop at the 
posted stop sign in violation of 22450 CVC-Failure to stop at a stop sign.  The vehicle then turned south 
onto Marlborough Ave St then west onto Meade Ave again failing to make a full and complete stop at the 
posted stop sign in violation of 22450 CVC.  The pickup continued on Meade Ave,  turned south on 41st 
St, then west on El Cajon Blvd once again violating of 22450 CVC.   
 
The pickup truck continued west on El Cajon Boulevard then turned north onto the 15 freeway.  Average 
speeds were approximately 30 mph due to heavy traffic.  We then merged onto the 8 east freeway. The 
pickup exited Fairmont Ave but began driving north in the south bound lanes in violation of 21651(B) 
CVC-Driving the wrong way.  We continued to follow the pickup in the north bound lanes.  The pickup 
then entered the 8 west on-ramp and we continued to follow it west on the 8 freeway.  Speeds averaged 
around 85 mph due to decreased traffic.  We continued the pursuit west on the 8 freeway until Morena 
Blvd exit.  The pickup truck exited Moreno Blvd heading north.  Officer Colvin #1512 deployed spike

sticks at the Moreno Blvd ramp puncturing all four tires of the pickup truck.  See Officer Colvin's report for 
further information.    
 
The pickup continued north on Moreno Blvd then turned west on Savannah Street which is a dead end. 
As the pickup truck came to a stop, the male driver, later identified by his California driver's license as 
Evan Baltsas, attempted to flee on foot west up an embankment with a black backpack towards Tecolote 
Rd.  The female passenger, later identified by her California driver's license as 
, stayed in the 
truck and was detained and handcuffed by officers.  
 
SDPD Canine Officers were able to detain Baltsas before he could make it up the embankment as 
myself and other officer's approached Baltsas.  See SDPD Canine Officer's reports for further 
information.  I pointed my department approved handgun at Baltsas as I approached him.  Baltsas did 
not resist further and was handcuffed and taken back to our patrol vehicle.   
 
A record check of Baltsas showed he had two active felony warrants. 
 
Warrant #
 was issued on 10/23/2023 for 459 PC by Judge L. Parsky of the San Diego 
Superior Court with No Bail.   
 
Warrant #
 was issued on 11/02/2023 for 11379 HS by Judge R. Shelton with a $75000 bail 
amount.   
 
During a search of Baltsas's black backpack I discovered a medium vacuum-sealed plastic bag with a 
white crystalline substance inside the smaller outer pouch.  In the main pouch of the backpack, I 
discovered a small plastic baggie of a white crystalline substance.  Based on my training and experience 
I believed it to be a controlled substance.  
 
Also in the main compartment of his backpack contained a black extendable baton.  During a search of 
the pickup truck, I located two shaved keys.  One was found on the center console and the other below 
the center console on the carpet.  Both shaved keys were able to start the stolen pickup.   
 
Pictures of the truck, white crystalline substance, baton and the shaved keys were uploaded to 
Evidence.Com via the Axon Capture application.   
 
The white crystalline substance was impounded as evidence at Headquarters property room under 
barcode #11497727. 
 
The extendable baton was impounded as evidence at Headquarters property room under barcode 
#11497726. 
 
The shaved keys were impounded as evidence at Headquarters property room under barcode

While | was enroute, other officers located the vehicle and attempted to make a vehicle stop. The vehicle did not yield and a
traffic pursuit was initiated. See Officer Acosta-Garcia's #1946 arrest and recovery report for further. | initially attempted to
catch up to the pursuit as it was heading East on the 8 freeway. | then diverted to contact the original reporting party.

| made my way to 4000 Meade and contacted the reporting party, i. and took her statement. She
essentially told me the following:

Statement fa

truck was stolen on 02/19/24. The truck is very recognizable and a lot of people know it's J because he
has been driving it for so long. Today i]. ET called me saying she saw it parked behind the Vons located

found it again at Central Avenue and Meade Avenue. | called Police and tried following it again. The truck was driving East on
Meade Avenue, but did a full 180 in the Marlborough Roundabout. As they turned around, | got a good look at the driver's face
and would be able to identify him.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

On 02-23-2024 at approximately 1505 hours | responded to a radio call regarding a stolen vehicle in the area of Van Dyke
Avenue and Meade Avenue. The reporting party stated she saw JM in law's stolen truck and was following behind. A
request for Canine was put out over the radio and | responded shortly after.

While enroute to the area, Mid-City officers broadcasted they were in a failure to yield with the stolen truck (SDPD Case
#24300923M). The driver of the stolen vehicle was later identified as Evan BALTSAS. | responded to the area and was able
to catch up with the pursuit at Interstate 8 West at Hotel Circle North.

Prior to my arrival | was notified by the pursuing officers that the driver was going to be under arrest for felony pursuit
(2800.2(A) VC). | aired over the radio that if the driver was going to run from the vehicle on city streets, my PSD was going to
be deployed. | was unable to give Canine warnings over the vehicle loudspeaker initially due to my positioning in the pursuit
and the constant radio traffic being broadcasted.

The vehicle exited Morena Boulevard from Interstate 8 West and continued northbound. As it exited the off ramp, spike strips
were deployed and successfully deflated several tires on the vehicle. During this pursuit, | saw Baltsas drive at a high rate of
speed on the shoulder. Baltsas was also driving with several flat tires and the back side of his vehicle was losing control. |
saw Baltsas almost strike several vehicles on Morena Boulevard.

Baltsas continued to flee from police with flat tires and made a turn onto 4800 Savannah Street, which is a dead end. Just
before the vehicle stopped, | could see Baltsas reaching around inside the vehicle and appeared to be looking for something.
Baltsas did not immediately exit the vehicle, it appeared to me that he was reaching for something to take with him. | saw him
then exit the vehicle with a backpack.

| yelled to Baltsas that if he did not stop, he was going to be bitten by a police dog. Baltsas ignored the command and began
fleeing on foot.

For the following reasons, | released my Police Service Dog to assist with the apprehension of Baltsas:

The seriousness of the offense:

Baltsas was wanted for 10851(a) CVC - Auto Theft and 2800.2(a) VC - Felony Evading. Both felony crimes. Based on my
training and experience, | know that subjects in possession of stolen vehicles often use the vehicles in relation to other crimes,
including crimes of violence. | have personally been involved in several vehicle theft incidents where officers have been shot
or shot at.

Baltsas posed an immediate threat to officers and citizens:

After an eight-mile pursuit where he drove the wrong way, ran red lights, and his vehicle tires had been deflated, Baltsas still
refused to comply and ran from the vehicle.

Baltsas deliberately brought a bag with him from inside the vehicle that was large enough to contain various types of
weapons, including a firearm.

Baltsas was running towards citizens stopped in traffic who were unaware of the pursuit. 
 
Baltsas was actively resisting: 
 
Baltsas refused for over eight miles to stop for fully marked patrol cars with lights and sirens activated. Stop sticks were 
utilized in an attempt to stop Baltsas, yet he continued attempting to evade arrest after stop sticks deflated his tires. As he 
reached a dead end, rather than comply, Baltsas fled from the vehicle, ignoring orders to stop and began running towards 
citizens stopped in traffic just north of the pursuit.  
 
Based on the above, I deployed PSD Chico (C-1307) from the vehicle and released him on his bite command.  
 
My PSD pursued Baltsas as he fled, and I briefly lost sight of them behind some tall brush. When I changed positions, I could 
see my PSD had bitten Baltsas' backpack, which Baltsas then shed. After shedding the backpack, the PSD transitioned to 
Baltsas right shoulder where he bit and held.  
 
Knowing Baltsas was under arrest for the felony auto theft and pursuit, and the fact that he was continuing to actively resist 
arrest, I drew my firearm and pointed it at Baltsas and said ""Hands up"" several times.  Baltsas did not comply by showing me 
his hands immediately and I continued to say, ""Hands up.""  
 
Baltsas then began to comply several seconds later and myself and several officers moved up to take him into custody. 
 
As I moved up, I waited for Officers to take control of his hands.  I then removed PSD Chico from the bite. 
 
Baltsas sustained an injury to his ear and several puncture marks consistent with a dog bite on his right shoulder.  Officers 
transported Baltsas to the hospital for treatment.  Baltsas was charged with 2800.2 (a) VC, 10851 (a) VC, 979 (F) PC and 
several narcotics related charges. 
 
My body worn camera was activated for this incident.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

Officer's Narrative:

On February 23, 2024, at approximately 1511 hours, | was on-duty, in full police uniform and driving a fully marked San Diego
Police vehicle when | heard dispatch state that both Western and Mid City Division were patched for a traffic pursuit on the
Interstate 8 westbound in San Diego, California.

| assisted in the traffic pursuit by taking a post at the Morena Boulevard offramp for Interstate 8 westbound. | retrieved the
stop sticks from the trunk of my fully marked police vehicle and staged them in case the suspect/driver, later identified as
Evan Baltsas via Cal-photo, took said offramp.

Shortly after, | observed a green Chevrolet Silverado , Which was driven by Baltsas, being pursued by
numerous fully marked San Diego Police vehicles with their overhead red and blue lights activated, accompanied by their
sirens. Four uninvolved vehicles already on the offramp had come to a complete stop. Baltsas continued to drive on the
shoulder of the offramp's traffic lane at which point | positioned my stop sticks directly in front of his vehicle while using a
protected concrete median as my cover. Baltsas drove over my stop sticks which resulted in all four tires being deflated.

Immediately after the successful deployment of my stop sticks, | had realized my BWC was not activated. | immediately
activated my BWC and captured the stop stick deployment during the two-minute buffer period.

As | arrived onto 4800 Savannah Street, | observed Baltsas fleeing from the driver seat of the vehicle on foot. Baltsas fled
northwest onto an embankment that leads to Tecolote Road. Officer Quintanilla #7410 utilized his Police Service Dog (PSD)
to apprehend Baltsas as he fled. Given that Baltsas was actively resisting arrest for multiple felony offenses, and knowing
from my training and experience that persons involved in auto theft related offenses are commonly armed, | approached
Baltsas and briefly pointed my firearm at him while instructing him to show his hands. Once | could see Baltsas's hands were
clear, | approached and took hold of his right arm while coordinating with Officer Quintanilla and other officers to take Baltsas
into custody as well as pat him down for weapons. Once Baltsas was handcuffed and the PSD was removed from the bite, |
walked with Baltsas back to a patrol car where | evaluated his injuries. Baltsas had injuries on his upper right arm and left ear
that were consistent with a dog bite. During the evaluation, Baltsas was laughing about, and mocking the PSD bite. Baltsas
also stated that he did not need to go to the hospital and wanted officers to dump some alcohol on the injury.

Following the PSD apprehension, | assisted Officer Quintanilla with photos of the scene, and briefly went to the hospital to
assist with any follow-up.

REPORT NARRATIVE

On 02-23-2024, | was on duty as a San Diego Police Officer, dressed in police uniform, and driving a marked police vehicle. |
was assigned to traffic collision investigation and traffic enforcement duties in the Collision Investigation Bureau of the San
Diego Police Department's Traffic Division. At approximately 1516 hours, | responded to a radio call of a traffic pursuit by San
Diego Police Officers of a stolen automobile in the area of Interstate 8 West and Morena Boulevard in the Morena
neighborhood in the city and county of San Diego.

 

| saw a green Chevrolet Silverado MI traveling northbound on 800 Morena Boulevard after striking a spike strip
on the Interstate 8 West off-ramp to Morena Boulevard. There was a box truck on the off-ramp blocking pursuing Officers
from exiting onto Morena Bouvard to pursue the Chevrolet Silverado, hereafter referred to as the suspect vehicle. | activated
my police vehicle's solid and flashing red and blue lights facing to the front and rear and an audible siren. | pursued the
suspect vehicle northbound on 800 Morena Boulevard as it continued traveling with four flat tires at an approximate speed of
35 miles per hour. The suspect vehicle proceeded north through the intersection of Morena Boulevard and Linda Vista
Boulevard in violation of 21453(a) VC - Red Signal Lamp. The suspect vehicle continued north on 900 Morena Boulevard and
turned west onto 4800 Savannah Street. The suspect vehicle approached the termination of that roadway which was defined
by a berm. The driver quickly exited the suspect vehicle, ran west towards the berm, was pursued, and detained by other
Officers.

With the knowledge that the suspect vehicle was reported to be stolen and had been recklessly evading an enforcement stop
by police officers, | reasonably believed that the occupants of the suspect vehicle may have been armed and posed a danger
to myself, other Officers, and members of the general public. | removed my department issued service pistol from my holster
and pointed it in the direction of the suspect vehicle while approaching the right passenger door. | pointed my department
issued service pistol at a female sitting in the #3 seating position, later identified as MJ. and told her to put her
hands up, which she did. | removed a black purse from the lap of J due to the fact that it may have contained a
weapon which [ij would have had access to, and threw the purse onto the ground next to the vehicle. There was not
sufficient time to divide my attention from J to gently place the purse onto the ground. | removed J seatbelt
and told her to exit the vehicle while facing the right side of the suspect vehicle, which she did. Another Officer detained

fF and placed her in handcuffs. Upon determining that there were no other occupants in the suspect vehicle, | placed
my department issued service pistol back into my holster.

Refer to Officer P. CHASE's #1568 Arrest Report for further information.

SYNOPSIS: 
 
On 02/18/2024, 
 parked his 1995 Chevrolet Silverado 
 on 
4500 40th Street. On 02/20/2024, 
 discovered his vehicle had been stolen. There was 
only one key for the vehicle, and it was in 
 possession.  
 
On 02/23/2024, 
 located 
 vehicle 
occupied by two subjects at 36th Street near Adams Avenue. The vehicle was moving, and 
 followed it while calling the police. In addition, the original license was taken 
off and an Arizona plate was on the vehicle. 
 
As 
 was on the phone with police, Officers arrived and initiated a traffic stop. The 
driver, Evan Baltsas failed to yield to the Officers and a pursuit ensued. Baltsas had a 
female passenger in the vehicle, 
.  
 
After multiple traffic violations, Officers were able to “Stop Stick” the vehicle and it came 
to rest 4800 Savannah Street, San Diego. Baltsas fled from the vehicle and a Police 
Service Dog was released and bit Baltsas. He was eventually taken into custody and later 
booked into jail for the above listed charges.    
 
A part of the pursuit was captured by ABLE.  
 
I am requesting the San Diego District Attorney’s Office issued the above listed charges.  
 
INVESTIGATION:  
 
On February 26, 2024, I was assigned the listed case for investigation. I reviewed the 
associated reports and the Body Worn Camera footage.  
 
During my review of the report, I reviewed Officer Chase’s arrest report. In his report he 
detailed the traffic violations and route of the pursuit. Below is a synopsis of the traffic 
violations. 
 
• 42nd Street/Monroe Avenue - 22450 VC - Failure to Stop at a Stop Sign 
• Marlborough Avenue/Meade Avenue - 22450 VC - Failure to Stop at a Stop Sign  
• 41st Street/El Cajon Blvd - 22450 VC - Failure to Stop at a Stop Sign 
• Southbound Fairmount Avenue near 8 Freeway (driving northbound in southbound 
lanes – 21651(B) VC – Driving Wrong Way on Roadway 
• 85mph Westbound 8 Freeway – 22350 VC- Speed 
 
On the Morena Blvd exit from the 8 Freeway, Officer Colvin deployed spike strips and 
successfully punctured all four tires.

Case number #24300923

The vehicle turned west onto Savannah Street which is a dead end. Towards the dead
end, Baltsas stopped the vehicle, grabbed a black backpack, and attempted to run away.
Below is a snippet from ABLE Flir video:

 

He was bitten by K9 Officer Quintanilla’s Police Service Dog. Baltsas was taken into
custody without further incident.

During the bite by the Police Service Dog, Baltsas sustained an injury to his left ear and
right shoulder. Baltsas was later transported to the hospital and received medical
treatment. Officers took photos of his injuries:

Case number #24300923 
 
 
The passenger, 
, remained in the vehicle after Baltsas fled, and she was taken 
into custody without incident. She was later released at the scene.  
 
Officer Chase searched the black backpack that was in Baltsas’ possession. Inside the 
backpack, Officer Chase located a small plastic baggie of a white crystallin substance in a 
small out pouch. A black expandable baton was also located in the backpack.  
 
During a search of the vehicle, Officer Chase located two makeshift tools that Officer 
Chase determined to be able to start the vehicle. He used the tools and successfully 
started the vehicle.

Case number #24300923 
 
 
The victim, 
, was notified and arrived at the scene to take custody of the 
vehicle. 
 
I checked the area for video surveillance where the vehicle was stolen from, but I did not 
locate any.  
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
Baltsas has an extensive criminal history. Multiple arrests for 10851 VC, 459 PC, 
narcotics, and various theft related crimes. He is currently on supervised probation.

CONCLUSION: 
 
I have reviewed all the attached reports. All the necessary elements of the offense are 
present; the contact with and/or detention of the suspect was appropriate; and there was 
probable cause or other legal basis to arrest and/or search the suspect. It is felt that the 
attached reports by the participating officers are complete and sufficient, and it is 
requested that the District Attorney’s Office issue a complaint charging the suspect with 
the listed violations together with any additional charges and/or sentencing enhancements 
as may be appropriate.

instructions. However, once I instructed Dryer several times to bend at the waist, spread his butt cheeks and cough three 
times he became non-compliant by making non-intelligible statements and erratic movements by squatting up and down and 
slapping his buttocks multiple times. Corporal Chen and I instructed Dryer to face the wall and put his hands behind his back. 
As I was about to take out my handcuffs with my left hand, Dryer swatted my left hand with his right arm and turned towards 
me in an assaultive stance.  
 
Due to Dryer's assaultive behavior and verbal non-compliance, I utilized my left and right arm and upper body strength to pull 
Dryer's head and upper body to the floor. While pulling Dryer to the floor, I used verbal commands and instructed Dryer to get 
on the floor and to not resist deputies. The initial force was effective as it allowed Dryer to be placed in a position of 
disadvantage by landing on the floor on the right side of his body. However, he continued to resist and be assaultive to 
deputies by thrashing his body side to side and up and down and striking me with both his hands towards the middle of my 
abdomen, in which contacted my Body Warn Camera (BWC) and knocked it off my body. Also, Dryer continued to thrash his 
legs contacting the right side of my body and grabbing onto my duty belt and facility keys. To overcome Dryer's active 
resistance and assaultive behavior, I utilized a total of 12 left and right closed fist strikes to Dryer's left upper back and left side 
of face. After, Dryer complied, and I was able to transition to his legs. The additional force was effective as it allowed me to 
secure Dryer's feet in leg chains. Had I not used force, Dryer would have been able to assault myself more or assault 
responding deputies. 
 
Corporal Chen was present and assisted me in controlling Dryer's Head (See Corporal Chen Officer Report for further details). 
Deputy Jackson #1267 arrived on scene and pointed his Conductive Electronic Device (CED) (See Deputy Jackson's Officer 
Report for further details). Corporal Aguilera #4166 arrived on scene and assisted with grabbing, pulling and securing Dryer's 
arm. (See Corporal Aguilera's Officer Report for further details. Corporal Hill #3784 arrived on scene and assisted with 
securing Dryer's right arm (See Corporal Hill's Officer Report for further details).  Deputy Sanders #6869 arrived on scene and 
secured Dryers hands into handcuffs. 
 
Dryer was assisted on to the medical gurney and into the recovery position. Sgt. Nesmith #7609 was the safety officer. Nurse 
 arrived on scene and conducted a medical evaluation. Nurse 
 determined that Dryer sustained a 
laceration above his right eye. Doctor 
 and Nurse 
 arrived on scene and conducted a medical 
evaluation. Doctor 
 determined that Dryer should seek further treatment at the hospital. 
 
Dryer was escorted to the 1st Floor on a medical gurney in waist and leg chains. Medic 21 arrived, and Dryer was assisted off 
the medical gurney. Dryer was on the medical gurney for approximately 21 minutes. Dryer was transported to the University of 
California San Diego (UCSD) Hospital. 
 
My Body Worn Camera Footage was recording during a portion of this incident. 
 
INJURIES:  
 
Dryer sustained a laceration along his right eyebrow, approximately 2 inches in length. The laceration was closed with 13 
sutures at UCSD Hospital.

REPORT NARRATIVE
Origin:

On 12-11-2023 | was assigned to the Movement Sergeant Position at the San Diego Central Jail (SDCJ), when | obtained a
statement from Incarcerated individual Dryer, Gino BN23749321.

Deputy's Observations and Actions:

At approximately 1030 hours, | spoke with Dryer in a holding cell on the 8th floor regarding a use of force that occurred
several days prior. Prior to entering the holding cell, | activated my department issued body worn camera to record our
conversation. While in the holding cell | advised Dryer | was there to speak with him regarding a use of force that that took
place several days ago. Dryer immediately stated, ""| may have been disrespectful towards the deputies because | felt | was at
the end of my rope."" Dryer went on to state how he felt he keeps getting arrested for no apparent reason. Dryer also stated
that while in the search room he was instructed to bend over at the waist. Dryer stated at no point did he tell the deputies he
wasn't going to listen to their instructions. Dryer went on to state that a deputy approached him and asked him to bend at the
waist and when he didn't, the deputy just punched him. Dryer then began to talk about other issues that he had during our
conversation such as his property being misplaced, the same cops contacting him while he's on the streets, and how he
doesn't feel safe around law enforcement. | then ended my conversation with Dryer.

| had no further contact with Dryer.

REPORT NARRATIVE

Origin:

On 12/4/23, | was assigned at the Search Deputy position on the Second Floor of the San Diego Central Jail (SDCJ).
Deputy's Observations and Actions:

At approximately 0710 hours, Deputy Harter #4907 and | were notified by SDCJ Nurse (aye that she had completed

her medical assessment on incarcerated person Gino Dryer BN 23749321 and that he was cleared to continue the booking
process.

 

Deputy Harter and | escorted Dryer inside the search room on the Second Floor of SDCJ with the intention to dress him out in
jail clothing and perform a visual cavity search. Dryer refused to follow instructions when asked to separate his buttocks with
his hands so that we could perform a visual cavity search. Dryer only slapped his buttocks with his hands when we repeated
our instructions. We ordered Dryer to face the wall and put his hands behind his back for handcuffing. Dryer did not comply
and displayed assaultive behavior by using his right hand to swat Deputy Harter's hand away when he attempted to handcuff
him.

Deputy Harter initiated a takedown by pulling Dryer to the floor. Dryer ended up on his right side on the floor while | was near
his head in a kneeling position with his back facing me. | used my left and right fists to strike Dryer in the face and the rear of

his head for a total of six times. I did this in order to deter further assaultive behavior by Dryer. If I had not used this force, 
Dryer may have continued his assaultive behavior and possibly injured Deputy Harter. The use of force was unsuccessful, as 
Dryer began to thrash his arms. 
 
Dryer began to thrash his arms once he was on the floor, which I interpreted as an assaultive gesture. Dryer had also grabbed 
onto Deputy Harter's equipment belt with his left hand and appeared to be reaching for Deputy Harter with his right. I delivered 
five hammer fists to Dryer's upper shoulder and back with my left and right hands and one strike to the back of his head. I did 
this in order to get Dryer to release his grasp on Deputy Harter's equipment belt. If I had not used this force, Dryer may have 
been able to take equipment from Deputy Harter's belt and use it against us. The use of force was successful, as the strikes 
caused Dryer to release Deputy Harter's belt.  
 
I placed my right hand on Dryer's head and applied downward pressure for approximately one minute to pin it to the floor. I did 
this in order to gain control of Dryer so that he could be restrained in a prone position and placed in handcuffs and leg 
restraints.  If I had not used this force, Dryer would have continued to remain uncontrolled in an inefficient position for 
handcuffing. The use of force was not successful, as Dryer remained on his right side while continuing to refuse to place his 
left arm behind his back. 
 
Dryer displayed assaultive behavior by attempting to kick Deputy Harter when he attempted to restrain his legs. Dryer also 
raised his left arm towards me in what I interpreted as an attempt to grab me.  I used my left fist to strike Dryer in the face 
three times. Dryer also grabbed my right hand with his right arm. I did this to deter Dryer from attempting to kick Deputy Harter 
and stop him from grabbing me. If I had not used this force, Dryer may have attempted to kick Deputy Harter again or grab 
me. The use of force was successful, as Dryer did not attempt to continue to kick Deputy Harter and let go of my right hand. 
Dryer refused to follow instructions to place his left arm behind his back. I used my left hand to pull Dryer's left hand away 
from his body and behind his back. I did this so that Dryer could be handcuffed. If I had not used this force, Dryer would have 
remained uncontrolled. The use of force was successful, as it allowed deputies to place handcuffs on Dryer's left wrist.

Deputies arrived on scene with a gurney. I supported Dryer's left shoulder as he was assisted onto the gurney.  
 
SDCJ Health staff arrived on scene to evaluate Dryer. It was determined that Dryer would need to be transported to the 
hospital to treat a wound above his eye.  
 
I escorted Dryer via gurney to the vehicle sallyport on the First Floor of SDCJ with the assistance of other deputies. Dryer was 
transported to UCSD Hillcrest without further incident. 
 
I had no further contact with Dryer.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

 

ORIGIN:

On 12/04/2023, | was working the Intake Deputy Position at the San Diego Central Jail. | was involved in a use of force with
Incarcerated Person (IP) Gino Dryer (23749321).

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATION AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 0708 hours, | heard yelling coming from the Search Room on the Second Floor. | ran into the Search Room
and saw Corporal Chen (3627) and Deputy Harter (4907) attempting to place Dryer on his stomach. Dryer was violently
thrashing his body from side to side, refusing to follow instructions and tucking his arms into his stomach area. Dryer
attempted to prevent us from turning him onto his stomach to apply handcuffs. | immediately assisted Corporal Chen and
Deputy Harter by getting a hold of Dryer's left arm. | pushed Dryer onto his stomach with my right hand and simultaneously
pulled Dryer's left arm with my left hand then placed his left arm behind his back. | then grabbed a hold of Dryer's right arm
and pulled it out from underneath his stomach and placed it against his back. Dryer's wrists were secured in handcuffs, and he
stopped resisting. The force used was effective as | was able to assist in placing Dryer on his stomach and secure his wrists
in handcuffs. If | had not used force on Dryer, Dryer could have stood up and continued to fight the other deputies.

Once we all had control of Dryer, Dryer was assisted on a medical gurney and medically evaluated.
It was determined that Dryer would need further medical treatment at a hospital.

Dryer was escorted to the first-floor vehicle sally port and was transferred to the ambulance gurney. Dryer was transported to
UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center via ambulance. No additional force was used.

| had no further contact with Dryer.

BWC captured a portion of this incident.

BACKGROUND:  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Ramirez 
 
 
  
 
Alcohol manufactured by persons who are incarcerated is commonly referred to as ""pruno"" in the 
jail/prison system.  Although there are numerous ways of manufacturing ""pruno"" in jail, the most common 
procedure is for incarcerated persons to mix fruit, sugar, and bread in a plastic bag with warm water, 
allowing the contents to ferment for a period of time.  All ingredients in the bag eventually develop 
alcohol content which produces side effects similar to those of traditional alcoholic beverages. 
 
 
INVESTIGATION:  
 
At approximately 1618 hours, I completed my safety check of the housing unit, and returned to A Module 
to investigate Cell #109 which emitted the odor of what I believed to be ""pruno"" inside. Deputies Juarez 
#3055, Trejo #4354, Lozada 3349, and I entered  A Module to conduct a cell search inside Cell #109. 
The cell door was opened, and I observed two incarcerated persons (IP), later identified as 
 
 and Carlos Ramirez #23741438, standing near the back of the cell. I instructed both IPs 
to step outside the cell so we could conduct a search. 
 was hesitant to follow my instructions, but 
ultimately began slowly walking towards me while Ramirez remained in the back of the cell. While 
standing in the threshold of the cell door, I observed a clear plastic bag containing a red liquid substance 
sitting in the sink which I believed to be ""pruno"" (IP manufactured alcohol). As 
 approached the door, 
he quickly turned and grabbed the ""pruno"" and began dumping it in the cell toilet. To prevent 
 from 
further destroying evidence, I entered the cell and grabbed him by his arms with both of my hands. My 
force was effective, and 
 dropped the plastic bag which still contained a small amount of ""pruno"" 
inside of it. Had I not used force on 
 he would have been able to destroy evidence  and dispose of 
the ""pruno"" before it could be collected. I continued to hold 
 arms and could feel he tensed up his 
arm and attempted to escape my grasp. I attempted to pull 
 down to the ground, however IP 
Ramirez rushed towards me from the back of the cell and struck me in the back, chest, and back of my 
head with a closed fist. I observed Deputy Juarez attempting to gain control of Ramirez, but Ramirez 
continued his attack and struck Deputy Juarez in the back of his head, knocking his hat off his head (See 
Officer's Report by Deputy Juarez).

I used both hands to push 
 away from me and turned to assist Deputy Juarez. I immediately felt 
what I believed to be a closed fist strike to the right side of my back and could feel my duty belt being 
pulled back towards the cell door. I turned back around and observed 
 being pulled away from me 
and taken down by Deputy Lozada (See Officer's Report by Deputy Lozada). I refocused my attention 
towards Ramirez who was still actively fighting Deputy Juarez. Deputy Trejo was now inside the cell, and 
I observed him attempting to gain control of Ramirez (See Officer's Report by Deputy Trejo). I observed 
Deputy Juarez wrap his arms around Ramirez and pull him down to the ground. Ramirez landed on his 
back and immediately began kicking Deputy Juarez and was pulling Deputy Trejo by his exterior vest 
simultaneously. To prevent Ramirez from continuing his attack on us and to prevent him from inflicting 
further injuries, I knelled beside him and delivered approximately four closed fist strikes to Ramirez' 
abdomen. My force was ineffective, and Ramirez continued his attack and struck me in the face with a 
closed fist. I gave verbal commands for Ramirez to stop fighting and delivered approximately four knee 
strikes to his right thigh. My force was again ineffective, and Ramirez continued kicking his legs at us and 
refused to place his hands behind his back. I observed Ramirez kick Deputy Juarez in the stomach and 
immediately delivered approximately four additional knee strikes to Ramirez' right thigh. My force was 
effective, and Ramirez stopped kicking his legs, but refused to place his hands behind his back. Had I 
not used force on Ramirez he would have continued to attack and kick deputies, which could have 
resulted in serious injuries. Ramirez remained defiant on the cell floor and would not allow his hands to 
be removed from underneath his body so he could be secured in handcuffs.  
 
A radio call for ""Cover Now"" (Deputies need help/11-99) was transmitted over the GBDF Tac 1 channel 
and multiple deputies and supervisors from the George Bailey Detention Facility responded to House 1A 
at Rock Mountain. Corporal Romo #3261, Deputy Sanchez #4751, and Deputy King #4211 were the first 
additional deputies on scene and entered Cell #109 to help gain control of Ramirez (See Officer's 
Reports by Corporal Romo, Deputy King & Deputy Sanchez). To gain control and secure Ramirez in 
handcuffs, I grabbed Ramirez by his left arm and pulled it out from underneath his stomach. My force 
was effective, and Ramirez was no longer able to keep his hands underneath him and allowed Deputy 
Juarez to handcuff him. Had I not used force on Ramirez he could have continued to have control of his 
hands and punch deputies again. I maintained control of his left arm while Deputy Juarez handcuffed 
him. Deputy King was able to secure Ramirez' right arm and Deputy Juarez was able to secure the 
handcuff on Ramirez' right wrist. I could hear a gargling sound and observed Ramirez spitting onto the 
cell floor. To prevent any of the spit contacting deputies, I placed a spit sock over his head. Additional 
deputies arrived on scene and Ramirez was secured in leg chains by Deputy Lake #3304. 
 
Lieutenant Jensen #7052 authorized the use of a gurney to escort Ramirez out of the module. While 
supporting Ramirez' left shoulder, I lifted him off the ground and placed him on the gurney in the prone 
position. Ramirez was secured with safety straps and escorted out of the module and into the House 1 
Entry Hallway to be assessed by RMDF Health Staff. Corporal Kerns #3999 was assigned as the Safety 
Officer and monitored Ramirez' wellbeing. While still on the gurney, Ramirez released from the gurney 
straps temporarily so he could be placed on his side in a recovery position before being evaluated. 
RMDF Nurse 
 evaluated Ramirez and determined his injuries required further 
evaluation and requested he be transported to the hospital via ambulance. Corporal Smith #7074 notified

 the 
Miranda Admonishment verbatim from a department issued Deputy's Notebook. I asked 
 if he 
understood his rights and he stated he did. I asked 
 if he was willing to speak with me and he 
replied, ""About what? I didn't do anything there was nothing in there."" I again asked 
 if he was willing 
to speak with me and he did not give me a response.

INVESTIGATION (continued):  
 
 
I took photographs of 
 for evidence purposes, and he was subsequently transported via Deputy car 
to GBDF House 6A, pending disciplinary sanctions. 
 was also afforded the opportunity to be 
evaluated by RMDF Health Staff, but 
 denied medical attention. He later signed a medical refusal 
form. 
Lieutenant Jensen took photographs of Ramirez and the injuries he sustained for evidence purposes. At 
approximately 1700 hours, Ramirez was escorted through RMDF Processing, was placed into AMR #38, 
and was transported to the hospital. In total, Ramirez was secured on the gurney for approximately 35 
minutes. 
 
I entered the House 1 Recreation Yard and took photographs of Deputy Juarez and Deputy Trejo and 
their injuries for evidence purposes. Deputy Trejo photographed me and my injuries for evidence 
purposes as well. I entered A Module and recovered a small amount of ""pruno"" from the plastic bag and 
secured it inside a plastic container. I took photographs of the scene and secured the cell door.  
 
I entered the RMDF Evidence Room and copied all photographs and Facility Closed Circuit Television 
Footage (CCTV) related to this incident onto a Compact Disc (CD). I retrieved the ""pruno"" and poured a 
sample of the liquid into a Nalgene container which contains preservatives to stop the fermentation 
process and prevent the liquid from spoiling. The Nalgene bottle was secured and transported to the 
GBDF Evidence Refrigerator, pending laboratory testing. Photographs of the ""pruno"" were copied onto a 
Compact Disc (CD) and secured in GBDF Evidence Locker #12. The CD containing photographs and 
CCTV Footage was processed and secured in GBDF Evidence Locker #12.

On 11/25/2023, at approximately 1200 hours, I contacted Ramirez who had since returned from the 
hospital and was housed in Medical Observation Cell 
.  
 
I conducted an interview with Ramirez.  
 
 
STATEMENTS:  
 
Statements of Carlos Ramirez (Suspect):  
 
I read Ramirez the Miranda Admonishment verbatim from a department issued Deputy's Notebook. I 
asked Ramirez if he understood his rights and he stated he did. I asked Ramirez if he was willing to 
speak with me and he replied, ""Yes, I will speak to you.""  
 
I asked Ramirez if he remembered what happened the day prior. He stated  he does and I asked him to 
explain what he thought happened. Ramirez responded by saying, ""You guys tell me man, you guys 
started it."" I explained to Ramirez  I was attempting to conduct a cell search for ""pruno"" when 
 
 (
 attempted to flush it down the toilet.  I went on to tell him I  tried to stop him from dumping 
the bag when he (Ramirez) charged towards me and struck me in the head and chest. Ramirez 
acknowledged  he did in fact attack me and stated, ""You guys know our rules, I have to get involved if 
you are fucking with one of us."" I asked Ramirez if he realized  he punched and kicked multiple deputies 
and he stated  he did and stated, ""I had to handle business… it is what it is."" I asked Ramirez if he had 
any additional comments or questions and he said, ""No."" 
 
I concluded my interview with Ramirez.

of my face and back by Ramirez and punched in the right side of my back by 
 Deputy Juarez was 
struck in the right side of his head, face, and chest by Ramirez. Deputy Trejo was punched in his neck 
and chest by Ramirez. As a result of the attack, Deputy Juarez sustained redness and swelling to his 
right knee and pain to the back of his head. Deputy Trejo sustained redness to his neck and complained 
of pain to his chest. I sustained bruising and swelling to my left knee, an abrasion on my right forearm, 
redness to the left side of my face, and pain to the back of my head. Both incarcerated persons were 
evaluated by RMDF Health Staff who subsequently cleared 
 for housing, but recommended Ramirez 
be transported to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  
 
I copied all photographs and Facility Closed Circuit Television Footage (CCTV) related to this incident 
onto a Compact Disc (CD) and secured the CD inside Evidence Locker #12. All Deputies involved desire 
prosecution in this case.  
 
 
ORIGIN:  
 
On 11/24/2023 I was assigned as the House 1 Floor Deputy at the Rock Mountain Detention Facility 
(RMDF). While conducting a safety check in A Module, I noticed a strong odor of alcohol inside Cell 
A109.  
 
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Ramirez 
 
 
  
 
Alcohol manufactured by persons who are incarcerated is commonly referred to as ""pruno"" in the 
jail/prison system.  Although there are numerous ways of manufacturing ""pruno"" in jail, the most common 
procedure is for incarcerated persons to mix fruit, sugar, and bread in a plastic bag with warm water, 
allowing the contents to ferment for a period of time.  All ingredients in the bag eventually develop 
alcohol content which produces side effects similar to those of traditional alcoholic beverages.

At approximately 1618 hours, I completed my safety check of the housing unit, and returned to A Module 
to investigate Cell #109 which emitted the odor of what I believed to be ""pruno"" inside. Deputies Juarez 
#3055, Trejo #4354, Lozada 3349, and I entered  A Module to conduct a cell search inside Cell #109. 
The cell door was opened, and I observed two incarcerated persons (IP), later identified as 
 
 
 and Carlos Ramirez #23741438, standing near the back of the cell. I instructed both IPs 
to step outside the cell so we could conduct a search. 
 was hesitant to follow my instructions, but 
ultimately began slowly walking towards me while Ramirez remained in the back of the cell. While 
standing in the threshold of the cell door, I observed a clear plastic bag containing a red liquid substance 
sitting in the sink which I believed to be ""pruno"" (IP manufactured alcohol). As 
 approached the door, 
he quickly turned and grabbed the ""pruno"" and began dumping it in the cell toilet. To prevent 
 from 
further destroying evidence, I entered the cell and grabbed him by his arms with both of my hands. My 
force was effective, and 
 dropped the plastic bag which still contained a small amount of ""pruno"" 
inside of it. Had I not used force on 
 he would have been able to destroy evidence  and dispose of 
the ""pruno"" before it could be collected. I continued to hold 
 arms and could feel he tensed up his 
arm and attempted to escape my grasp. I attempted to pull 
 down to the ground, however IP 
Ramirez rushed towards me from the back of the cell and struck me in the back, chest, and back of my 
head with a closed fist. I observed Deputy Juarez attempting to gain control of Ramirez, but Ramirez 
continued his attack and struck Deputy Juarez in the back of his head, knocking his hat off his head (See 
Officer's Report by Deputy Juarez).  
 
I used both hands to push 
 away from me and turned to assist Deputy Juarez. I immediately felt 
what I believed to be a closed fist strike to the right side of my back and could feel my duty belt being 
pulled back towards the cell door. I turned back around and observed 
 being pulled away from me 
and taken down by Deputy Lozada (See Officer's Report by Deputy Lozada). I refocused my attention 
towards Ramirez who was still actively fighting Deputy Juarez. Deputy Trejo was now inside the cell, and 
I observed him attempting to gain control of Ramirez (See Officer's Report by Deputy Trejo). I observed 
Deputy Juarez wrap his arms around Ramirez and pull him down to the ground. Ramirez landed on his 
back and immediately began kicking Deputy Juarez and was pulling Deputy Trejo by his exterior vest 
simultaneously. To prevent Ramirez from continuing his attack on us and to prevent him from inflicting 
further injuries, I knelled beside him and delivered approximately four closed fist strikes to Ramirez' 
abdomen. My force was ineffective, and Ramirez continued his attack and struck me in the face with a 
closed fist. I gave verbal commands for Ramirez to stop fighting and delivered approximately four knee 
strikes to his right thigh. My force was again ineffective, and Ramirez continued kicking his legs at us and 
refused to place his hands behind his back. I observed Ramirez kick Deputy Juarez in the stomach and 
immediately delivered approximately four additional knee strikes to Ramirez' right thigh. My force was 
effective, and Ramirez stopped kicking his legs, but refused to place his hands behind his back. Had I 
not used force on Ramirez he would have continued to attack and kick deputies, which could have 
resulted in serious injuries. Ramirez remained defiant on the cell floor and would not allow his hands to 
be removed from underneath his body so he could be secured in handcuffs.  
 
A radio call for ""Cover Now"" (Deputies need help/11-99) was transmitted over the GBDF Tac 1 channel 
and multiple deputies and supervisors from the George Bailey Detention Facility responded to House 1A 
at Rock Mountain. Corporal Romo #3261, Deputy Sanchez #4751, and Deputy King #4211 were the first

additional deputies on scene and entered Cell #109 to help gain control of Ramirez (See Officer's 
Reports by Corporal Romo, Deputy King & Deputy Sanchez). To gain control and secure Ramirez in 
handcuffs, I grabbed Ramirez by his left arm and pulled it out from underneath his stomach. My force 
was effective, and Ramirez was no longer able to keep his hands underneath him and allowed Deputy 
Juarez to handcuff him. Had I not used force on Ramirez he could have continued to have control of his 
hands and punch deputies again. I maintained control of his left arm while Deputy Juarez handcuffed 
him. Deputy King was able to secure Ramirez' right arm and Deputy Juarez was able to secure the 
handcuff on Ramirez' right wrist. I could hear a gargling sound and observed Ramirez spitting onto the 
cell floor. To prevent any of the spit contacting deputies, I placed a spit sock over his head. Additional 
deputies arrived on scene and Ramirez was secured in leg chains by Deputy Lake #3304. 
 
Lieutenant Jensen #7052 authorized the use of a gurney to escort Ramirez out of the module. While 
supporting Ramirez' left shoulder, I lifted him off the ground and placed him on the gurney in the prone 
position. Ramirez was secured with safety straps and escorted out of the module and into the House 1 
Entry Hallway to be assessed by RMDF Health Staff. Corporal Kerns #3999 was assigned as the Safety 
Officer and monitored Ramirez' wellbeing. While still on the gurney, Ramirez released from the gurney 
straps temporarily so he could be placed on his side in a recovery position before being evaluated. 
RMDF Nurse 
 evaluated Ramirez and determined his injuries required further 
evaluation and requested he be transported to the hospital via ambulance. Corporal Smith #7074 notified 
RMDF Central Control to activate 911. While Ramirez was being evaluated by Nurse 
, I was 
notified  
 had been escorted out of the module by Deputy Lozada and Deputy Gourley #4421. They 
escorted 
 to the House 1 Multi-Purpose Room. I entered the House 1 Multi-Purpose Room and

evaluated by RMDF Health Staff, but 
 denied medical attention. He later signed a medical refusal 
form. 
Lieutenant Jensen took photographs of Ramirez and the injuries he sustained for evidence purposes. At 
approximately 1700 hours, Ramirez was escorted through RMDF Processing, was placed into AMR #38, 
and was transported to the hospital. In total, Ramirez was secured on the gurney for approximately 35 
minutes. 
 
I entered the House 1 Recreation Yard and took photographs of Deputy Juarez and Deputy Trejo and 
their injuries for evidence purposes. Deputy Trejo photographed me and my injuries for evidence 
purposes as well. I entered A Module and recovered a small amount of ""pruno"" from the plastic bag and 
secured it inside a plastic container. I took photographs of the scene and secured the cell door.  
 
I entered the RMDF Evidence Room and copied all photographs and Facility Closed Circuit Television 
Footage (CCTV) related to this incident onto a Compact Disc (CD). I retrieved the ""pruno"" and poured a 
sample of the liquid into a Nalgene container which contains preservatives to stop the fermentation 
process and prevent the liquid from spoiling. The Nalgene bottle was secured and transported to the 
GBDF Evidence Refrigerator, pending laboratory testing. Photographs of the ""pruno"" were copied onto a 
Compact Disc (CD) and secured in GBDF Evidence Locker #12. The CD containing photographs and 
CCTV Footage was processed and secured in GBDF Evidence Locker #12. 
 
On 11/25/2023, at approximately 1200 hours, I contacted Ramirez who had since returned from the 
hospital and was housed in Medical Observation Cell 
.  
 
I conducted an interview with Ramirez.  
 
 
STATEMENTS:  
 
Statements of Carlos Ramirez (Suspect):  
 
I read Ramirez the Miranda Admonishment verbatim from a department issued Deputy's Notebook. I 
asked Ramirez if he understood his rights and he stated he did. I asked Ramirez if he was willing to 
speak with me and he replied, ""Yes, I will speak to you.""  
 
I asked Ramirez if he remembered what happened the day prior. He stated  he does and I asked him to 
explain what he thought happened. Ramirez responded by saying, ""You guys tell me man, you guys 
started it."" I explained to Ramirez  I was attempting to conduct a cell search for ""pruno"" when 
 
(
 attempted to flush it down the toilet.  I went on to tell him I  tried to stop him from dumping 
the bag when he (Ramirez) charged towards me and struck me in the head and chest. Ramirez 
acknowledged  he did in fact attack me and stated, ""You guys know our rules, I have to get involved if 
you are fucking with one of us."" I asked Ramirez if he realized  he punched and kicked multiple deputies 
and he stated  he did and stated, ""I had to handle business… it is what it is."" I asked Ramirez if he had 
any additional comments or questions and he said, ""No.""

REPORT NARRATIVE

ORIGIN:

 

On 11/24/2022, | was assigned as the Classification Deputy at the George Bailey Detention Facility (GBDF). | responded to a
""Cover Call"" (Officer needing immediate assistance) which was broadcasted via radio at Rock Mountain Detention Facility, A
Module Cell #109. | was involved in a use of force with incarcerated person (IP) Ramirez, Carlos (Booking #23741438) at the
Rock Mountain Detention Facility (RMDF).

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

When | arrived to RMDF, A Module Cell #109, | observed deputies inside the cell attempting to restrain incarcerated person
(IP) Ramirez, Carlos (Booking #23741438).

Ramirez was on the ground and actively resisting deputies attempting to restrain him by thrashing his arms and legs. Ramirez
appeared to be making attempts to move his body underneath the bunk in the cell. To prevent him from going underneath the
bunk, | entered the cell and grabbed Ramirez’ right leg and pulled it toward me. The force | used was effective in gaining
control of Ramirez and | assisted in placing him in the prone position for handcuffing. If | had not used force, Ramirez would
have continued to thrash his arms and legs possibly resulting in injury to staff.

Once Ramirez was in the prone position, | maintained downward pressure on Ramirez’ left leg with my right knee as | assisted
Deputy Juarez, M. #3055 in handcuffing him. After Ramirez was handcuffed, Deputy Lake #3304 secured leg chain on him |
exited the cell and had no further contact with Ramirez.

On 11/24/2023, | was assigned to work the Floor Deputy position at the Rock Mountain Detention Facility (RMDF) when |
contacted incarcerated persons (7/@yEy (b)(6)(B) and Carlos Ramirez# 23741348 inside Cell A109.

 

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 1620 hours, Corporal Mansheim #4147 and | entered 1A Module to conduct a cell search inside A109, due
to the cell emitting a strong odor of ""Pruno” (jail manufactured alcohol). Corporal Mansheim instructed both incarcerated
persons to exit the cell in order for us to safely conduct the search. IP @@@ began walking towards the door, when he
suddenly lunged towards a small bag of ""Pruno” which was sitting in the cell sink. Corporal Mansheim immediately entered the
cell and grabbed to prevent him from destroying evidence (See Officer's Report by Corporal Mansheim).

applied downward pressure on both of Ramirez' legs until additional deputies arrived on scene so they could assist with 
Ramirez.  
 
Deputies arrived on scene with a gurney. I positioned myself to Ramirez' right side of his body to place handcuffs on him. I 
successfully handcuffed Ramirez. With the assistance of other deputies on scene, I picked up Ramirez by the right side of his 
body while supporting his shoulder to prevent injury to Ramirez. Ramirez was successfully placed on the gurney and wheeled 
out of the module.  
 
I had no further contact with Ramirez.

On 11/24/2023, | was assigned as the Central Rover at the Rock Mountain Detention Facility (RMDF) when Corporal
Mansheim #4147 and Deputy Juarez #3055 notified me Module A Cell #109 smelled of jail manufactured alcohol (pruno)
while conducting a safety check.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 1618, Corporal Mansheim, Deputy Juarez, Deputy Lozada #3349 and | approached Module A Cell #109 to
conduct a search due to the smell of pruno coming from the cell. Upon approaching the cell, we observed a bag of pruno on
top of the toilet. Incarcerated persons (IP's) Ramirez, Carlos BN 23741438 and Qjy@yep TED) were instructed
to exit Cell #109. Upon exiting the cell, IP gig} grabbed the bag of pruno and attempted to dump it into the toilet. When
Corporal Mansheim attempted to handcuff @g@ey Ramirez rushed behind Corporal Mansheim and struck him in the back.

  

| went inside of Cell #109 to prevent Ramirez from further injuring Corporal Mansheim and to secure Ramirez in handcuffs.
While inside of the cell Ramirez struck me in the chest with his hand using a closed fist. Due to Ramirez’ active assaultive
behavior, | struck the left side his forehead twice with my right closed fist. This force was effective and caused Ramirez to
stumble and fall to the floor.

Ramirez landed on his back on the cell floor and landed underneath the desk between the wall and stool. | attempted to roll
Ramirez onto his stomach to be handcuffed, however he continued to resist by pushing away my hands. While still on the
floor, Ramirez grabbed toward my vest and duty belt. In order to handcuff Ramirez, prevent him from further attacking my
partners and I, and to prevent Ramirez from trying taking hold of me, | struck Ramirez with two additional closed fist strikes. |

used my right fist to strike the middle of Ramirez' forehead. The force I used was sufficient in preventing Ramirez from further 
injuring Deputies. Had I not used force, Ramirez could have inflicted serious bodily injury and continued his attack on Corporal 
Mansheim, Deputy Juarez, and myself.  
 
A call for ""cover"" (deputies need help) was broadcasted on the facility radio by Control Deputy Robles #0456. When additional 
deputies arrived on scene, Ramirez was handcuffed, leg chained, and placed on a gurney on his stomach inside of Cell #109. 
Ramirez was escorted via gurney to the House 1 House Entry Hallway to be evaluated by Nurse 
. While in 
the hallway Ramirez was placed into the recovery position by Corporal Kerns #3999. Nurse 
 determined Ramirez 
needed to be sent to the hospital via 911 for further evaluation. 
 
I had no further contact with Ramirez.

REPORT NARRATIVE

ORIGIN:

 

On 11/24/2023, | was assigned as a House 5 Floor Deputy at the George Bailey Detention Facility (GBDF). At approximately
1621 hours, | responded to a ""Cover Call"" at the Rock Mountain Detention Facility (RMDF).

INVESTIGATION:

| entered RMDF House 1A and saw Deputy Juarez #3055, Corporal Sanchez #4751, and Corporal Mansheim #4147
attempting to gain control of incarcerated person Carlos Ramirez #23741438 inside of Cell #109. | entered Cell #109. | went to
the back of the cell. Ramirez was thrashing his body, not allowing deputies to secure him. In order to help gain control of
Ramirez, | used both of my hands and applied downward pressure to Ramirez's head. Ramirez was handcuffed by Deputy
Juarez(See Deputy Juarez’ Deputy Report) and leg chained be Deputy Lake #3304. Ramirez offered no additional resistance;
therefore, | stopped applying downward pressure to his head. Deputy Rico #4379 handed me a ""spit sock"" and | placed it over
Ramirez’ head.

Once Ramirez was secured, a gurney was brought inside of the cell. | placed my hands under each of Ramirez’ shoulders and
assisted him onto the Gurney. Ramirez was escorted via gurney to the RMDF staging area for medical evaluation.

| had no further contact with Ramirez.

Statement of Ramirez, Carlos BN 23741438: 
 
I introduced myself to Ramirez and informed him I was there to speak to him about the incident that occurred the previous 
day.  I asked Ramirez what happened, and he said, ""They [Deputies] walked in and approached 
 
 
] and I practically helped him out."" I asked Ramirez to describe what he meant. Ramirez said the deputies came 
into the cell and dropped his juice in the toilet so he decided to ""help"" 
 out. Ramirez informed me he was an alcoholic and 
was upset the alcohol had been thrown out. I asked him what happened after, and Ramirez said he punched the deputy 
because he was upset about the alcohol being discarded away. I asked Ramirez if he had alcohol in the cell. Ramirez 
confirmed there was alcohol in the cell and it belonged to him. Ramirez said he punched the deputy in the face and then it 
was, ""game over."" I asked Ramirez what he meant by ""game over."" Ramirez said there wasn't much he could do because 
there was what he estimated to be five deputies present.  Ramirez said after he punched the deputy, the deputies present 
""took care of it."" Ramirez did not describe in detail what he meant. Ramirez said he didn't remember the whole incident. 
Ramirez confirmed he was sent to the hospital where he was informed he fractured his nose, but sustained no additional 
major injures.  Ramirez did not know the names of the deputies involved. Ramirez had no additional information to add to the 
interview. 
 
 
DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS (Continued): 
 
I ended the interview at approximately 1143 hours and had no additional contact with Ramirez.

Anderson is approximately 6'1'' 300 lbs. Due to his size and agitated state I felt I would need at least another deputy to reason 
and escort Anderson to court holding in order to avoid any potential issues. 
 
At approximately 0400 hours Deputies Sosa #3509, Castillo #4897, and Rondero-Rojo #4336, and I entered House 1B 
Module to speak to Anderson about his court refusal. To see if Anderson would react differently to another Deputy I stepped 
to the side and let Deputy Sosa speak to Anderson. Deputy Sosa let Anderson know it was time to go to court. Anderson 
complied with Deputy Sosa's instruction but was groaning and mumbling incoherent words. The muscles in his face were 
tense and his face was red. Anderson put on his jail issued blues and stated, ""I don't know why you guys are fucking making 
me do this, I don't want to go to fucking court."" Deputy Sosa explained to him it is a part of jail operations and we are doing 
our job. Deputy Sosa convinced him to leave the quad. Anderson walked out of the module on his own with his cane. We 
escorted Anderson outside of the module. Once we arrived at the House Corridor he stopped walking, turned around and 
faced me and said, ""I don't have to go to fucking court."" I told him to face away and keep walking or else I would place him in 
handcuffs for not obeying my instructions. Anderson complied. He turned around and walked down towards GBDF 
Processing. During our escort to GBDF Processing, Anderson said ""You're a bitch for this."" He continued cursing specifically 
at me and called me a bitch a couple more times.  
 
Once we arrived at Processing, Deputy Sosa instructed Anderson to face the wall and stop talking, while we determined 
which holding cell he would be secured in. Anderson ignored Deputy Sosa's instructions and turned to face me. Anderson 
tensed up his body and said, ""You ain't nothing but a bitch."" After that he took a bladed stance, stared at me and said, ""Take 
off your badge and let's see what you're about."" I instructed him to turn around and face the wall. Anderson then quickly raised 
his arms with closed fists and lunged towards me with his upper body as if he was going to attack me.  
 
In order to prevent Anderson from assaulting me I delivered an elbow strike to his face. I saw that Anderson raised his arms 
and I felt he might try to strike me. To stop him from doing this I delivered two closed fist strikes to his face. The first strike was 
with my left hand and the next one was with my right hand on the left side of his face. Deputies Sosa and Castillo grabbed 
Anderson by an arm on each side. I grabbed Anderson on the back of the neck and shoulder area. I applied downward 
pressure to push him to the floor. I gave verbal commands to stop resisting as I felt his body tense up as I pushed him to the 
floor. My force was successful in preventing Anderson from assaulting me or any of the other deputies present. We were able 
to force Anderson onto the floor. Once on the floor Anderson was compliant.  
 
Deputies Mccullen #3124 Enciso #6191 Denison #3743 and Calderon #4384, who were assigned to Processing were present 
during the incident. Deputies Mccullen and Enciso handcuffed Anderson. Anderson continued to be compliant.  
 
At approximately 0410 hours, Sgt. Romero #7800 arrived on scene and was informed about the incident. 
 
GBDF Health staff and a gurney was requested to processing. Once they arrived, Deputies Mccullen, Calderon, and Denison 
assisted Anderson onto the gurney. Anderson rolled himself to his side. Deputy McCullen took hold of Anderson's left arm and 
Deputy Denison took hold of Anderson's right arm and assisted him to his feet. Once Anderson was on his feet, he sat on the 
gurney. Deputy Calderon grabbed Anderson's right shoulder and helped Anderson slide higher on the gurney as he was in the 
seated position. Deputy McCullen was the safety deputy during the escort to medical. Deputies Do #0361 and Robledo 
#4453, who were assigned to GBDF Medical escorted Anderson to the GBDF Medical where he was evaluated and treated by 
GBDF Health staff. Anderson was then transported to the Alvarado Hospital via Ambulance for further evaluation and 
treatment.    
 
At 0500 hours, I went to Concentra Urgent Care for evaluation and was treated for my injured right thumb.  
 
I had no further contact with Anderson.  
 
At approximately 0500 hours on 10/28/2023 I uploaded the digital photographs and CCTV footage of the incident onto a 
compact disc for evidence. I submitted all related evidence into GBDF Evidence locker #12.

REPORT NARRATIVE

On 10/26/2023, | was assigned as the House 1 Floor Deputy at the George Bailey Detention Facility (GBDF) when a use of
force with Incarcerated Person (IP) Anderson, Ryan (BN23741609) occurred while escorting him to processing for court.

 

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 0400 hours, Deputy Castillo 4897, Gonzalez 4398, Sosa 3509, and | were escorting I/P Anderson to
processing after he'd initially refused to go to court.

While in the House 1 corridor, I/P Anderson became upset and agitated and began to yell profanities at us. Deputy Sosa
instructed Anderson to face the wall to cuff up, but Anderson refused to follow instructions. After Deputy Sosa spoke with
Anderson, we were able to have him walk to processing without any further incident.

Once we arrived in processing, Deputy Sosa instructed Anderson to face the wall until we figured out which holding cell he
was going in. Anderson said, ""I'm going to fuck you guys up” and refused to follow the instructions. | saw Anderson turn
toward Deputy Gonzalez and clench his fists. Anderson then took a bladed stance and lunged toward Deputy Gonzalez.

Before Anderson could strike Deputy Gonzalez, Deputy Gonzalez threw three strikes at Anderson, hitting him on his face.
Deputies Sosa, Castillo and Gonzalez took Anderson to the floor. | did not assist on the takedown.

Once on the floor | removed Deputy Gonzalez from the use of force because he had injured his hand and walked him to
GBDF medical.

| had no further contact with I/P Anderson.

On 10/26/2023, | was assigned as the House 1 Floor Deputy at the George Bailey Detention Facility (GBDF) when | was
involved in a use of force with Incarcerated Person (IP) Anderson, Ryan (BN23741609) escorting him to processing for court.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

At approximately 0400 hours, Deputy Sosa 3509, Gonzalez 4398, Rondero-Rojo 4336, and | were escorting I/P Anderson to
processing because he was refusing to go to court.

While in the House one corridor, I/P Anderson began to tell us to ""Fuck off,"" and said, ""Im going to fuck you up."" Deputy Sosa
instructed him to face the wall to cuff up but Anderson refused to follow instructions.

Once we arrived in processing, Deputy Sosa instructed Anderson to face the wall until we figured out what holding cell he was
going in. Anderson said, ""I'm going to fuck you guys up.” and refused to follow the instructions. | saw Anderson make fists with
his hands and take a bladed stance towards Deputy Gonzalez 4398 and lunged toward Deputy Gonzalez.

Before Anderson could strike Deputy Gonzalez, Deputy Gonzalez threw three strikes at Anderson that hit him on his face.

To prevent Anderson from hitting Deputy Gonzalez, | grabbed Anderson's left arm with both of my hands and used downward

pressure to pull him to the floor. Deputy Sosa grabbed Anderson's right arm, and Deputy Gonzalez grabbed Anderson's upper
back. My force was effective at stopping Anderson from hitting me and the other deputies.

REPORT NARRATIVE

 

 

 

Origin:

On 10/26/2023, | was assigned to work the Northside Sergeant position at the George Bailey Detention Facility (GBDF), when
| heard a radio call for assistance of GBDF medical staff to the Court Processing area.

Deputy's Observations and Actions:

At approximately 0412 hours, | arrived at the GBDF Court Processing area to see an Incarcerated Person (IP) later identified
as Ryan Anderson BK#23741609, on the floor with handcuffs on. Deputy McCullen #3124 advised me a use of force occurred
with Anderson and escorting deputies. Deputies assisted Anderson onto a gurney and GBDF Medical staff started assessing
Anderson for any injuries. GBDF Medical staff asked deputies to move Anderson to the Medical Dispensary to better assess
Anderson. The deputies moved Anderson to the Medical Dispensary.

| walked to the Watch Commander's office to retrieve a digital recorder so | may interview Anderson about the use of force
that just occurred.

At about 0425, | conducted a recorded interview with Anderson in the GBDF Medical Dispensary. Anderson said he was
offered his court medications but refused. He also told the deputies in the house that he refused to go to court. After talking to
a couple of the housing deputies he decided to go to court. Anderson said while in the sallyport he was calling the deputies
names and turned towards one of the deputies (Deputy Gonzalez #4398) and said, ""What are you going to do about it?"" While
facing Deputy Gonzalez, Anderson put his foot forward. Anderson said, ""I intimidated him. He got scared like a little bitch and
assaulted me."" | asked Anderson if he took a fighting stance. Anderson said he took a defensive stance. Anderson said he
didn't want to g to El Cajon court because it's an all-day process and he didn't want to wait. Anderson claimed the deputy
struck him ten times with his right hand.

| concluded my interview and had no further contact with Anderson.

to the request for canine assistance from the area of El Cajon. While driving to the call, the National City 
Police Department cancelled the request and I returned to my service area.  
 
At approximately 1521 hours, the National City Police Department contacted Sheriff's Communications 
and requested I return to the same incident. I responded to the request for canine assistance from the 
area of Santee.  
 
I arrived on scene at approximately 1539 hours.  
 
Upon arrival, I met with Sergeant Shanahan #393. Sergeant Shanahan informed me his officers were 
dispatched to a call of a male being aggressive, intoxicated and hitting cars. Sergeant Shanahan said the 
paramedics were also dispatched to the incident and, upon arrival, were told the male had a gun, so they 
backed out. When the officers arrived, they attempted to conduct a pedestrian hot stop, but the male 
walked away and entered apartment 2502. Sergeant Shanahan informed me the male was reaching and 
grabbing at his waistband while walking away from his officers.  Since that time, officers were able to 
identify the male as Zachariah Iban, determined he was a high-risk probationer who was on probation for 
assault with a deadly weapon and confirmed he did not live in that apartment. Sergeant Shanahan said 
his officers made contact with the 
 of 
who stated they did not know the male, 
had left their door unlocked and did not want him inside. The
 gave the police department 
permission to go inside. Sergeant Shanahan claimed his officers had remained on scene the entire time, 
ensuring me Iban was still inside the apartment.  
 
Officer Garcia #550 informed me she had spoken to the 
 of 
 who said there was 
no one else inside the apartment, but stated they had a small dog inside. Officer Garcia reiterated the 
fact that Zachariah Iban was reaching for his waistband when he walked away from them and into the 
apartment. I questioned the source of information about Iban possessing a firearm and she claimed it 
was reported to the fire department from citizens, but they were unable to reach the fire department for 
further.  
 
I contacted Sergeant Leyva #3394 of the Sheriff's Canine Unit. I briefed him of the incident's details and 
expressed my concern for safety of officers who might have to enter an apartment occupied by a male 
who resisted arrest and was reportedly armed with a firearm, despite the fact he was only wanted for 
trespassing and resisting arrest at the time. He agreed that officer safety was priority and believed the 
utilization of a canine during such a search was reasonable. We discussed possible solutions to working 
around the fact there was a dog inside the apartment and decided it was likely best to enter the 
apartment with my canine partner, Nike, on a leash in order to try to get the dog out of the apartment or 
locked into a bathroom before continuing the search.  
 
Lieutenant Ramirez #422 of the National City Police Department arrived on scene, assuming the position 
of incident commander. I briefed with Lieutenant Ramirez and Sergeant Shanahan. I informed them I 
was willing to assist them with a canine search inside the apartment, if they chose to make entry, but 
expressed my concerns for there being a dog inside. I told them I might have to start the search on lead

until the dog was removed from the search area. Lieutenant Ramirez informed me one of his tactical 
officers was retrieving their armored vehicle and bringing it to the scene. He said they would start by 
giving announcements from their armored vehicle and go from there.  
 
While awaiting the arrival of the armored vehicle, I opened my vehicle's front doors and placed old 
ballistic vests over each window. This provided me with more ballistic coverage should Zachariah Iban 
start shooting from the apartment. I then retrieved my department-issued rifle from the back of my vehicle 
and placed it on my passenger seat, for quick access.  
 
The apartment into which Zachariah Iban fled was a second story unit on the southeast corner of an 
eight-unit building. There were two upper units and two lower units facing east, with the other units facing 
west. The entrance to the units was recessed into the middle of the eastern wall. From my position, I 
could see all the apartment's windows, but could not see the doorway. I could only see the lower steps of 
the stairwell, which led to the door. Some of the apartments windows were open.  
 
The armored vehicle arrived and parked next to my patrol vehicle. I remained on the south side of the 
building with Sergeant Shanahan, Lieutenant Ramirez, a couple tactical officers, an agent and another 
patrol officer. A contact team was established at a patrol car positioned off the northeast corner of the 
building. The officers moved the vehicle south a short distance in order to better observe the doorway 
and stairwell, should Zachariah Iban exit.  
 
Officers began making announcements from the public announcement system on the armored vehicle. 
After a few rounds of announcements, I noted the volume appeared low. Wanting to ensure Zachariah 
Iban could hear the announcements, I requested they turn up the speaker's volume. The officer adjusted 
the volume and continued. After making the adjustment, I felt content with the speaker's volume and 
believed officer's commands were sufficiently loud that they would be heard by Iban, even if he was 
sleeping in the apartment. Officers continued giving commands for Zachariah Iban to come out of the 
apartment, calling him by name and giving the apartment number. Most of the officer's commands 
included the fact they had a police dog present and stated if he did not come out the dog would be sent 
inside and he would be bit. I believe it fair to say they gave dozens of canine warnings during the 
incident.  
 
During the time when officers were giving commands, I coordinated with an officer on the contact team 
who was holding a specialty munitions shotgun. I told him if Zachariah Iban came out of the apartment 
and was not following commands, I might request he deploy the specialty munitions shotgun in order to 
give my canine a safer opportunity to approach, potentially preventing Iban from drawing a firearm or 
being able to quickly retreat back into the apartment. The officer informed me he would deploy, upon my 
request.  
 
Officers were able to evacuate the rest of the building's residents, except those who lived on the opposite 
side of the landing. Officers gave those residents an order to shelter in place in a back bedroom, not 
wanting them to overexpose themselves during an evacuation.

Throughout this incident, large crowds of residents, including children, were gathered around our 
periphery. The groups were asked to leave multiple times, but kept returning. Ultimately, officer placed 
crime scene tape around a large portion of the complex to prevent onlookers from getting too close, 
interfering or being in harm's way.  
 
I was informed officers were attempting to contact probation and was later told they were obtaining a 
probation hold warrant. This led me to believe Zachariah Iban was now arrestable for violating his 
probation, which they said was for 
 This crime is for committing an 
 
. Having been convicted of such a crime, I believed Iban 
capable severe violence.  
 
The 
of apartment
 arrived on scene and expressed their concern for their dog, 
, who 
was inside the apartment. They informed me they heard her bark and were worried for her safety. 
Officers started making requests to Zachariah Iban to open the door and let the dog out, but Iban did not 
reply.  
 
After officers made request for Zachariah Iban to release the dog from the apartment, I noticed 
movement in a window. This was the first sign of movement, to this point. Until this point, I did not see or 
hear any movement from the apartment. Shortly thereafter, other officers confirmed they could see 
Zachariah Iban pacing back and forth, viewing him through the living room window. I looked through the 
living room window and saw him walking away from the apartment's front door, back toward the middle of 
the apartment. Another officer later noticed Iban look out a window on the south side of the building, 
stating he moved the blinds and put his face up to the glass. This activity led me to believe Iban was 
aware of our presence and likely plotting his next move. I was concerned there was the potential Iban 
might start shooting at us and was possibly assessing our locations for possible avenues of escape.  
 
Lieutenant Ramirez informed me the dog inside the residence was reportedly a small chihuahua, which 
the 
 said might be aggressive toward other dogs. I informed Lieutenant Ramirez my concern was 
not for the safety of Nike, rather, that if he was released into the apartment, he might start fighting with 
the small dog, distracting us from the danger Zachariah Iban posed. I suggested if we made entry into 
the apartment, two officers with guns enter in front of me and said I would follow with Nike on lead, 
assess and go from there.  
 
I informed Lieutenant Ramirez I thought a flash bang could be useful, believing it might get Zachariah 
Iban's attention and possibly convince him to exit. I would rather contact Iban outside the apartment than 
be forced to make entry into the apartment. If we had to make entry into the apartment, Iban would 
certainly have the tactical advantage. Since I knew he was aware of our presence and possibly armed 
with a gun, I worried it was possible Iban used furniture to barricade the apartments door, could be lying 
in wait, prepared for an ambush, or might ambush us on our approach to the apartment, up the narrow 
stairwell.

I was informed Lieutenant Ramirez was calling out their SWAT team and a CNT negotiator.  
 
At approximately 1724 hours, just over two hours after my arrival on scene and more than two and a half 
hours after the arrival of the National City Police Department, an officer advised the door was opening. At 
the time of this announcement, I was standing on the rear, driver's-side corner of the armored vehicle. 
There were no officers with me on that side. I decided to move forward to the driver's door of the armored 
vehicle, as a position of cover. I planned on using the door to give me a closer position from which to 
safely deploy Nike, if necessary. As I moved toward the front of the vehicle, Zachariah Iban had already 
stumbled out into the street, from the stairs. He stumbled quickly in the direction of the contact team. 
Officer began giving him commands to put his hands up, but he was not complying. I yelled, ""Hands up!"" 
When Iban regained his balance, he turned away from the officers of the contact team, not complying 
with their commands, and started moving in my direction. I yelled at him to get on the ground three times, 
but he continued walking toward me. While giving him commands to get on the ground, he raised his 
hands up slightly, exposing his palms, looked at me and pointed forward, with his right, index finger. I 
could see he did not have anything in his hands, but was unable tell if there was a gun or other weapon 
tucked in his waistband.  
 
Standing by myself on the driver's side of the armored vehicle, with Zachariah Iban advancing in my 
direction, ignoring all commands to put his hands up, stop or get on the ground, I feared for my safety. 
There were a handful of officers in the contact team on the other side of the apartment, but none of them 
would be able fire if Iban produced a weapon, because I was standing on the other side of him. Further, 
knowing there was a crowd gathered all around our scene, I worried Iban might try to flee and make his 
way into the crowd. Based upon the fact the call originated because Iban was being aggressive to 
residents, reportedly had a gun and was hitting cars, I worried he might attack anyone of the onlookers or 
potentially take them hostage. Further, if Iban reached the crowd, my force options to subdue him would 
be greatly limited because they might put others at risk of injury. Because of this, I believed I had to stop 
him before he got to me and certainly before he reached the crowd. Not wanting to go hands on with a 
potentially armed person, I believed the safest way of stopping Iban was to deploy Nike. No other force 
option I had at my disposal would allow me to do so, without sacrificing the safety of distance or 
compromising my chances of success. I believed deploying Nike would likely prevent Iban from reaching 
for a weapon or at least make it more challenging for him to manipulate one and prevent him from 
reaching me or getting to the crowd. 
 
I removed Nike's traffic lead and released my grip on his collar, giving him the command to bite 
Zachariah Iban. Nike ran at Iban, jumped and bit him on the inside of his upper, right arm. As Nike bit 
Iban, I ordered him to get on the ground. I drew my pistol and began walking at Iban, pointing my gun at 
him to be better prepared, should he produce a weapon. I continued to order Iban onto the ground and 
he sat down. Iban was holding Nike's front, right leg with his left hand and had his right arm around the 
back of Nike's neck. Iban responded to my commands to get on the ground, saying, ""Okay,"" and laid on 
his right side. With Iban showing signs of compliance, both lying down and replying okay to my 
commands, I believed it was safe to holster and detain him. Further, with Iban lying on his back and 
moving to his side, I had more time to scan his body for weapons and did not see any. I put my gun away

and grasped Iban's left hand, requesting the officers move in to assists by calling out, ""Hands."" The 
officers ran up and took control of Iban's left hand. I informed them not to grab his right arm and moved 
around to gain physical control of Nike. As I grasped Nike's collar with my left hand, I could see the 
officers had sufficient control of Iban, so I used my break stick to release Nike from the bite. Nike 
instantly released his grasp of Iban and I stepped back. The officers detained Iban in handcuffs and 
checked him for weapons. I later reviewed my body worn camera and found Nike was actively biting 
Zachariah Iban for approximately 16 seconds.  
 
I returned to my patrol car and placed Nike in the back seat.  
 
I asked the officers if they had requested paramedics respond to evaluate Zachariah Iban's injuries and 
they informed me they had.  
 
I used my vehicle's radio and requested Sheriff's Communications inform the Lakeside Substation's 
supervisor of the canine contact. Sergeant Serrato #4079 acknowledged the notification.  
 
American Medical Response's Medic 419 arrived on scene and the paramedics began evaluating 
Zachariah Iban.

I contacted Sergeant Serrato by phone to inform him of the incident's details. He informed me he would

I took photographs of the apartment, the location where Zachariah Iban was arrested and the location of 
the law enforcement vehicles.  
 
The officers did not find a firearm on Zachariah Iban's person. I asked the homeowners if they would 
allow the officers to search their apartment to ensure there was no gun left inside and they consented. As 
of the time I left the scene, no officer had located a firearm.   
 
Officer Garcia #550 of the National City Police Department informed me she was the arresting officer and

Officer Garcia informed me the medical staff was ready for me to take photographs of Zachariah Iban 
and told me she had read him his Miranda Rights, to which he acknowledged understanding of his rights 
and agreed to answer questions.  
 
I took photographs of Zachariah Iban and the injuries to his upper, right arm. There were numerous small 
lacerations around Iban's upper arm with one larger laceration on the inside. The larger laceration was 
approximately three inches in length. Most of the lacerations had been closed with sutures.  
 
I spoke to hospital staff and they informed me Iban had ten lacerations and was given 18 sutures.  
 
While standing in the hallway of the emergency room, Zachariah Iban got my attention. He informed me 
he was sorry for his actions, repeating his apology multiple times. I accepted his apology, telling him I did 
not take his actions personally, but appreciated the gesture.  
 
Sergeant Serrato interviewed Zachariah Iban, asking questions about the utilization of a Sheriff's canine. 
See Sergeant Serrato's report for further.  
 
Officer Garcia informed me she was going to book Zachariah Iban for residential burglary, resisting arrest 
and the probation violation warrant. Iban was booked into the San Diego County Central Jail, later that 
evening.  
 
While leaving the hospital, the crew of American Medical Response's Medic 419 began speaking with 
me, after offloading a different patient. Paramedic 
 and EMT 
 informed me 
they had initially responded to the call, but left and began asking questions about the incident. Recalling 
the mention of a gun came from responding paramedics, I took his statement. Paramedic 
 
statement was essentially as follows: 
 
 
STATEMENT OF 
(WITNESS/PARAMEDIC): 
 
 
 informed me he and his partner, 
 were dispatched to 817 Eta Street to 
assist a heavily intoxicated male. Upon arrival, a citizen approached 
 and informed him the 
intoxicated male had a gun, telling him they wanted the police, not fire. As 
was speaking with the 
citizen, another person told him the same. He reported this to his partner and the fire crew who had 
arrived after them, and they left the scene. 
 told me he overheard a third person in the complex 
mention the male was armed with a gun before they left. 
and 
 did not return to the scene 
until they were requested to evaluate Zachariah Iban, after being bit by Nike.

ORIGIN: 
 
 
On 08/19/23, at approximately 1447 hours, I was dispatched to 817 Eta Street, in National City, to assist 
the National City Police Department. The National City Police Department informed Sheriff's 
Communications they wanted a canine unit to assist them with a call of an intoxicated male who was 
hitting vehicles, possibly had a gun and walked into an apartment, against officers' commands.  
 
Event Number: E8730087 
 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
 
None 
 
 
INVESTIGATION: 
 
 
At the time of this incident, I was on-duty, in full uniform and driving a marked, Sheriff's, canine vehicle. I 
was working my regularly scheduled shift as a canine handler for the Lakeside Substation. I responded 
to the request for canine assistance from the area of El Cajon. While driving to the call, the National City 
Police Department cancelled the request and I returned to my service area.  
 
At approximately 1521 hours, the National City Police Department contacted Sheriff's Communications 
and requested I return to the same incident. I responded to the request for canine assistance from the 
area of Santee.  
 
I arrived on scene at approximately 1539 hours.  
 
Upon arrival, I met with Sergeant Shanahan #393. Sergeant Shanahan informed me his officers were 
dispatched to a call of a male being aggressive, intoxicated and hitting cars. Sergeant Shanahan said the 
paramedics were also dispatched to the incident and, upon arrival, were told the male had a gun, so they 
backed out. When the officers arrived, they attempted to conduct a pedestrian hot stop, but the male 
walked away and entered apartment 2502. Sergeant Shanahan informed me the male was reaching and 
grabbing at his waistband while walking away from his officers.  Since that time, officers were able to 
identify the male as Zachariah Iban, determined he was a high-risk probationer who was on probation for 
 and confirmed he did not live in that apartment. Sergeant Shanahan said 
his officers made contact with the 
 of apartment
 who stated they did not know the male, 
had left their door unlocked and did not want him inside. The

permission to go inside. Sergeant Shanahan claimed his officers had remained on scene the entire time, 
ensuring me Iban was still inside the apartment.  
 
Officer Garcia #550 informed me she had spoken to the 
 of apartment 
, who said there was 
no one else inside the apartment, but stated they had a small dog inside. Officer Garcia reiterated the 
fact that Zachariah Iban was reaching for his waistband when he walked away from them and into the 
apartment. I questioned the source of information about Iban possessing a firearm and she claimed it 
was reported to the fire department from citizens, but they were unable to reach the fire department for 
further.  
 
I contacted Sergeant Leyva #3394 of the Sheriff's Canine Unit. I briefed him of the incident's details and 
expressed my concern for safety of officers who might have to enter an apartment occupied by a male 
who resisted arrest and was reportedly armed with a firearm, despite the fact he was only wanted for 
trespassing and resisting arrest at the time. He agreed that officer safety was priority and believed the 
utilization of a canine during such a search was reasonable. We discussed possible solutions to working 
around the fact there was a dog inside the apartment and decided it was likely best to enter the 
apartment with my canine partner, Nike, on a leash in order to try to get the dog out of the apartment or 
locked into a bathroom before continuing the search.  
 
Lieutenant Ramirez #422 of the National City Police Department arrived on scene, assuming the position 
of incident commander. I briefed with Lieutenant Ramirez and Sergeant Shanahan. I informed them I 
was willing to assist them with a canine search inside the apartment, if they chose to make entry, but 
expressed my concerns for there being a dog inside. I told them I might have to start the search on lead 
until the dog was removed from the search area. Lieutenant Ramirez informed me one of his tactical 
officers was retrieving their armored vehicle and bringing it to the scene. He said they would start by 
giving announcements from their armored vehicle and go from there.  
 
While awaiting the arrival of the armored vehicle, I opened my vehicle's front doors and placed old 
ballistic vests over each window. This provided me with more ballistic coverage should Zachariah Iban 
start shooting from the apartment. I then retrieved my department-issued rifle from the back of my vehicle 
and placed it on my passenger seat, for quick access.  
 
The apartment into which Zachariah Iban fled was a second story unit on the southeast corner of an 
eight-unit building. There were two upper units and two lower units facing east, with the other units facing 
west. The entrance to the units was recessed into the middle of the eastern wall. From my position, I 
could see all the apartment's windows, but could not see the doorway. I could only see the lower steps of 
the stairwell, which led to the door. Some of the apartments windows were open.  
 
The armored vehicle arrived and parked next to my patrol vehicle. I remained on the south side of the 
building with Sergeant Shanahan, Lieutenant Ramirez, a couple tactical officers, an agent and another 
patrol officer. A contact team was established at a patrol car positioned off the northeast corner of the 
building. The officers moved the vehicle south a short distance in order to better observe the doorway 
and stairwell, should Zachariah Iban exit.

Officers began making announcements from the public announcement system on the armored vehicle. 
After a few rounds of announcements, I noted the volume appeared low. Wanting to ensure Zachariah 
Iban could hear the announcements, I requested they turn up the speaker's volume. The officer adjusted 
the volume and continued. After making the adjustment, I felt content with the speaker's volume and 
believed officer's commands were sufficiently loud that they would be heard by Iban, even if he was 
sleeping in the apartment. Officers continued giving commands for Zachariah Iban to come out of the 
apartment, calling him by name and giving the apartment number. Most of the officer's commands 
included the fact they had a police dog present and stated if he did not come out the dog would be sent 
inside and he would be bit. I believe it fair to say they gave dozens of canine warnings during the 
incident.  
 
During the time when officers were giving commands, I coordinated with an officer on the contact team 
who was holding a specialty munitions shotgun. I told him if Zachariah Iban came out of the apartment 
and was not following commands, I might request he deploy the specialty munitions shotgun in order to 
give my canine a safer opportunity to approach, potentially preventing Iban from drawing a firearm or 
being able to quickly retreat back into the apartment. The officer informed me he would deploy, upon my 
request.  
 
Officers were able to evacuate the rest of the building's residents, except those who lived on the opposite 
side of the landing. Officers gave those residents an order to shelter in place in a back bedroom, not 
wanting them to overexpose themselves during an evacuation.  
 
Throughout this incident, large crowds of residents, including children, were gathered around our 
periphery. The groups were asked to leave multiple times, but kept returning. Ultimately, officer placed 
crime scene tape around a large portion of the complex to prevent onlookers from getting too close, 
interfering or being in harm's way.  
 
I was informed officers were attempting to contact probation and was later told they were obtaining a 
probation hold warrant. This led me to believe Zachariah Iban was now arrestable for violating his 
probation, which they said was for 
 
 
 Having been convicted of such a crime, I believed Iban 
capable severe violence.  
 
The 
of apartment 
 arrived on scene and expressed their concern for their dog,
 who 
was inside the apartment. They informed me they heard her bark and were worried for her safety. 
Officers started making requests to Zachariah Iban to open the door and let the dog out, but Iban did not 
reply.  
 
After officers made request for Zachariah Iban to release the dog from the apartment, I noticed 
movement in a window. This was the first sign of movement, to this point. Until this point, I did not see or 
hear any movement from the apartment. Shortly thereafter, other officers confirmed they could see 
Zachariah Iban pacing back and forth, viewing him through the living room window. I looked through the

living room window and saw him walking away from the apartment's front door, back toward the middle of 
the apartment. Another officer later noticed Iban look out a window on the south side of the building, 
stating he moved the blinds and put his face up to the glass. This activity led me to believe Iban was 
aware of our presence and likely plotting his next move. I was concerned there was the potential Iban 
might start shooting at us and was possibly assessing our locations for possible avenues of escape.  
 
Lieutenant Ramirez informed me the dog inside the residence was reportedly a small chihuahua, which 
the owner said might be aggressive toward other dogs. I informed Lieutenant Ramirez my concern was 
not for the safety of Nike, rather, that if he was released into the apartment, he might start fighting with 
the small dog, distracting us from the danger Zachariah Iban posed. I suggested if we made entry into 
the apartment, two officers with guns enter in front of me and said I would follow with Nike on lead, 
assess and go from there.  
 
I informed Lieutenant Ramirez I thought a flash bang could be useful, believing it might get Zachariah 
Iban's attention and possibly convince him to exit. I would rather contact Iban outside the apartment than 
be forced to make entry into the apartment. If we had to make entry into the apartment, Iban would 
certainly have the tactical advantage. Since I knew he was aware of our presence and possibly armed 
with a gun, I worried it was possible Iban used furniture to barricade the apartments door, could be lying 
in wait, prepared for an ambush, or might ambush us on our approach to the apartment, up the narrow 
stairwell.  
 
I was informed Lieutenant Ramirez was calling out their SWAT team and a CNT negotiator.  
 
At approximately 1724 hours, just over two hours after my arrival on scene and more than two and a half 
hours after the arrival of the National City Police Department, an officer advised the door was opening. At 
the time of this announcement, I was standing on the rear, driver's-side corner of the armored vehicle. 
There were no officers with me on that side. I decided to move forward to the driver's door of the armored 
vehicle, as a position of cover. I planned on using the door to give me a closer position from which to 
safely deploy Nike, if necessary. As I moved toward the front of the vehicle, Zachariah Iban had already 
stumbled out into the street, from the stairs. He stumbled quickly in the direction of the contact team. 
Officer began giving him commands to put his hands up, but he was not complying. I yelled, ""Hands up!"" 
When Iban regained his balance, he turned away from the officers of the contact team, not complying 
with their commands, and started moving in my direction. I yelled at him to get on the ground three times, 
but he continued walking toward me. While giving him commands to get on the ground, he raised his 
hands up slightly, exposing his palms, looked at me and pointed forward, with his right, index finger. I 
could see he did not have anything in his hands, but was unable tell if there was a gun or other weapon 
tucked in his waistband.  
 
Standing by myself on the driver's side of the armored vehicle, with Zachariah Iban advancing in my 
direction, ignoring all commands to put his hands up, stop or get on the ground, I feared for my safety. 
There were a handful of officers in the contact team on the other side of the apartment, but none of them 
would be able fire if Iban produced a weapon, because I was standing on the other side of him. Further, 
knowing there was a crowd gathered all around our scene, I worried Iban might try to flee and make his

way into the crowd. Based upon the fact the call originated because Iban was being aggressive to 
residents, reportedly had a gun and was hitting cars, I worried he might attack anyone of the onlookers or 
potentially take them hostage. Further, if Iban reached the crowd, my force options to subdue him would 
be greatly limited because they might put others at risk of injury. Because of this, I believed I had to stop 
him before he got to me and certainly before he reached the crowd. Not wanting to go hands on with a 
potentially armed person, I believed the safest way of stopping Iban was to deploy Nike. No other force 
option I had at my disposal would allow me to do so, without sacrificing the safety of distance or 
compromising my chances of success. I believed deploying Nike would likely prevent Iban from reaching 
for a weapon or at least make it more challenging for him to manipulate one and prevent him from 
reaching me or getting to the crowd. 
 
I removed Nike's traffic lead and released my grip on his collar, giving him the command to bite 
Zachariah Iban. Nike ran at Iban, jumped and bit him on the inside of his upper, right arm. As Nike bit 
Iban, I ordered him to get on the ground. I drew my pistol and began walking at Iban, pointing my gun at 
him to be better prepared, should he produce a weapon. I continued to order Iban onto the ground and 
he sat down. Iban was holding Nike's front, right leg with his left hand and had his right arm around the 
back of Nike's neck. Iban responded to my commands to get on the ground, saying, ""Okay,"" and laid on 
his right side. With Iban showing signs of compliance, both lying down and replying okay to my 
commands, I believed it was safe to holster and detain him. Further, with Iban lying on his back and 
moving to his side, I had more time to scan his body for weapons and did not see any. I put my gun away 
and grasped Iban's left hand, requesting the officers move in to assists by calling out, ""Hands."" The 
officers ran up and took control of Iban's left hand. I informed them not to grab his right arm and moved 
around to gain physical control of Nike. As I grasped Nike's collar with my left hand, I could see the 
officers had sufficient control of Iban, so I used my break stick to release Nike from the bite. Nike 
instantly released his grasp of Iban and I stepped back. The officers detained Iban in handcuffs and 
checked him for weapons. I later reviewed my body worn camera and found Nike was actively biting 
Zachariah Iban for approximately 16 seconds.  
 
I returned to my patrol car and placed Nike in the back seat.  
 
I asked the officers if they had requested paramedics respond to evaluate Zachariah Iban's injuries and 
they informed me they had.  
 
I used my vehicle's radio and requested Sheriff's Communications inform the Lakeside Substation's 
supervisor of the canine contact. Sergeant Serrato #4079 acknowledged the notification.  
 
American Medical Response's Medic 419 arrived on scene and the paramedics began evaluating 
Zachariah Iban.  
 
Sergeant Carrillo #2821 of the Sheriff's Division of Inspectional Services contacted me by phone. He 
informed me he would be conducting the follow-up. I informed him the paramedics would be transporting 
Zachariah Iban to Paradise Valley Hospital for treatment. He informed me he would meet me there.

I contacted Sergeant Serrato by phone to inform him of the incident's details. He informed me he would 
meet me at the hospital for follow-up.  
 
I took photographs of the apartment, the location where Zachariah Iban was arrested and the location of 
the law enforcement vehicles.  
 
The officers did not find a firearm on Zachariah Iban's person. I asked the homeowners if they would 
allow the officers to search their apartment to ensure there was no gun left inside and they consented. As 
of the time I left the scene, no officer had located a firearm.   
 
Officer Garcia #550 of the National City Police Department informed me she was the arresting officer and 
would be accompanying Zachariah Iban to the hospital.  
 
I contacted Sergeant Leyva of the Sheriff's Canine Unit and informed him of the canine contact.  
 
The paramedics transported Zachariah Iban to Paradise Valley Hospital, where he was evaluated and 
treated by Doctor 
. While Iban was being treated, I briefed Sergeants Carrillo and Serrato of the 
incident's details. Corporal Patmon #1975 of the Sheriff's Canine Unit also attended the briefing.  
 
Officer Garcia informed me the medical staff was ready for me to take photographs of Zachariah Iban 
and told me she had read him his Miranda Rights, to which he acknowledged understanding of his rights 
and agreed to answer questions.  
 
I took photographs of Zachariah Iban and the injuries to his upper, right arm. There were numerous small 
lacerations around Iban's upper arm with one larger laceration on the inside. The larger laceration was 
approximately three inches in length. Most of the lacerations had been closed with sutures.  
 
I spoke to hospital staff and they informed me Iban had ten lacerations and was given 18 sutures.  
 
While standing in the hallway of the emergency room, Zachariah Iban got my attention. He informed me 
he was sorry for his actions, repeating his apology multiple times. I accepted his apology, telling him I did 
not take his actions personally, but appreciated the gesture.  
 
Sergeant Serrato interviewed Zachariah Iban, asking questions about the utilization of a Sheriff's canine. 
See Sergeant Serrato's report for further.  
 
Officer Garcia informed me she was going to book Zachariah Iban for residential burglary, resisting arrest 
and the probation violation warrant. Iban was booked into the San Diego County Central Jail, later that 
evening.  
 
While leaving the hospital, the crew of American Medical Response's Medic 419 began speaking with 
me, after offloading a different patient. Paramedic 
 and EMT 
 informed me 
they had initially responded to the call, but left and began asking questions about the incident. Recalling

the mention of a gun came from responding paramedics, I took his statement. Paramedic 
 
statement was essentially as follows: 
 
 
STATEMENT OF 
(WITNESS/PARAMEDIC): 
 
 
 informed me he and his partner, 
, were dispatched to 817 Eta Street to 
assist a heavily intoxicated male. Upon arrival, a citizen approached 
 and informed him the 
intoxicated male had a gun, telling him they wanted the police, not fire. As 
 was speaking with the 
citizen, another person told him the same. He reported this to his partner and the fire crew who had 
arrived after them, and they left the scene. 
told me he overheard a third person in the complex 
mention the male was armed with a gun before they left. 
and 
did not return to the scene 
until they were requested to evaluate Zachariah Iban, after being bit by Nike.  
 
 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUED:  
 
 
EMT 
 was present for 
 statement, affirming what was said and adding that a 
separate person also informed him the male had a gun. 
 
I was wearing a body worn camera during this incident. I captured one video of my time at the scene, 
one video of my time taking pictures of Zachariah Iban inside the hospital and one video of Paramedic 
 providing me with a statement.  
 
I copied the photographs I took of the scene and of Zachariah Iban onto a compact disc and placed it into 
evidence at the Lakeside Substation.  
 
I reported the utilization of my canine partner, Nike, to the San Diego County Department of Animal 
Services, via telefacsimile.

SYNOPSIS:

On 7/1/23 at approximately 1948 hours, | received a be on the lookout (BOL) of a stolen white 1997 Ford
F150 (CAG) driving eastbound on Palomar Airport Road from Melrose Drive in Carlsbad. |
located the stolen vehicle travelling eastbound on San Marcos Boulevard near South Rancho Santa Fe
Road in the city of San Marcos within the county of San Diego. | attempted to initiate a high-risk traffic
stop on the vehicle at 805 W San Marcos Boulevard. The driver of the F150, later identified as Brent
Ebert, failed to yield which resulted in a vehicle pursuit which lasted approximately 2.1 miles and
approximately 3 minutes. Throughout the pursuit, Ebert drove at high rates of speed, made numerous
unsafe lane changes, and drove on the wrong way of a divided roadway. The pursuit ended when Ebert
drove to the dead end of 877 Custer Avenue. Ebert fled on foot and failed to obey law enforcement's
commands to stop running. Deputies apprehended Ebert in the backyard of 877 Custer Avenue. As
Deputies attempted to detain Ebert, he resisted which resulted in a use of force, which caused injury to
Deputy Druda, Deputy Maldanado, Deputy Manibusan, and Ebert.

Sgt. Frierson was notified of the use of force.

responded to the area. Once additional units were in place, I attempted to initiate a high-risk traffic stop 
at the 800 block of W San Marcos Boulevard. The driver of the F150, later identified as Brent Ebert 
pulled into the parking lot of the shopping center on the south side of W San Marcos Boulevard.  Ebert 
failed to yield and sped out of the parking lot, driving over the curb and barely missing Corporal Buckley's 
(4063) patrol vehicle which was blocking the driveway to the parking lot. Ebert headed north on S Bent 
Ave and turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard. Ebert entered the eastbound State Route 78 
and exited at Twin Oaks Valley Road where he failed to stop for the red light and headed southbound on 
Twin Oaks Valley Road.  At Craven Drive, Ebert veered into the northbound lanes of South Twin Oaks 
Valley Road and continued southbound until turning eastbound onto Village Drive. We terminated the 
pursuit, turning off our overhead lights, following the vehicle at a safe distance.  Ebert was observed 
turning eastbound onto Wandering Way, southbound onto Savona Lane, eastbound onto Garland 
Avenue and finally northbound onto Custer Avenue. The vehicle pursuit lasted approximately 2.1 miles 
and approximately 3 minutes. Throughout the pursuit, Ebert drove at high rates of speed, up to 82 miles 
per hour on the freeway and 60 miles per hour on surface streets. Ebert made numerous unsafe lane 
changes and drove on the wrong side of a divided roadway. 
 
At the dead end of Custer Avenue, Ebert exited the vehicle and fled on foot. Since Ebert did not place 
the vehicle's transmission into park, it rolled back into the lead patrol vehicle. The patrol vehicle suffered 
minor damage to the front end. Traffic Deputy, Corporal Guerrero (0817) investigated the collision (see 
Case #23177566 for details). 
 
Deputy Druda (0639) began a foot pursuit and followed Ebert who climbed the fence on the side of the 
house located 877 Custer Avenue. Deputy Druda went through the gate and as he attempted to 
apprehend Ebert, a use of force ensued (see Deputy Druda's officer report). Corporal Maldonado came 
to assist Deputy Druda and was also involved in the use of force (see Corporal Maldonado's officer 
report). Deputy Haggerty (4097) and Deputy Manibusan (0640) assisted detaining Ebert (see Deputy 
Haggerty's officer report and Deputy Manibusan's officer report). During the use of force, Deputy Druda 
suffered redness and swelling to his left knee. Deputy Maldanado sustained redness and bruising to his 
right knee. Deputy Manibusan sustained scratches, redness, and minor bruising to his right forearm and 
wrist. Ebert suffered a laceration above his left eye, a fracture to his left cheek bone, an abrasion to his 
nose and two cuts to his right wrist. 
 
 
San Marcos Fire Department Engine #141 and RA #141 responded to the scene and transported Ebert 
to Palomar Medical Center for evaluation. 
 
Deputy Druda contacted the register owner of the stolen vehicle and released the vehicle to the owner at 
the scene. Deputy Druda contacted Stolen Vehicle System and removed the vehicle as stolen. A records 
check indicated the vehicle was stolen out of the city of San Diego on 06/17/2023. California Highway 
Patrol took the initial stolen vehicle report 
 Deputy Salazar photographed the 
recovered vehicle and of Deputy Druda and Deputy Manibusan.

ORIGIN: 
 
On 7/1/23 at approximately 1948 hours, I received a be on the lookout (BOL) of a stolen white 1997 Ford 
F150 (CA/
) driving eastbound on Palomar Airport Road. (E8631935) 
 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INVESTIGATION: 
 
On 7/1/23 at approximately 1948 hours, Corporal Vicencio (0426) and I received a be on the lookout 
(BOL) of a stolen white 1997 Ford F150 (CA/
) driving eastbound on Palomar Airport Road from 
Melrose Drive in Carlsbad. I was driving southbound on South Rancho Santa Fe Road and located a 
vehicle matching the description. The vehicle was crossing South Rancho Santa Fe Road traveling 
eastbound on San Marcos Boulevard in the city of San Marcos within the county of San Diego.  
 
I turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard, followed the vehicle, and confirmed the license plate 
as the stolen vehicle. Corporal Vicencio radioed the suspect vehicle's information and additional units 
responded to the area. Once additional units were in place, I attempted to initiate a high-risk traffic stop 
at the 800 block of W San Marcos Boulevard. The driver of the F150, later identified as Brent Ebert 
pulled into the parking lot of the shopping center on the south side of W San Marcos Boulevard.  Ebert 
failed to yield and sped out of the parking lot, driving over the curb and barely missing Corporal Buckley's 
(4063) patrol vehicle which was blocking the driveway to the parking lot. Ebert headed north on S Bent 
Ave and turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard. Ebert entered the eastbound State Route 78 
and exited at Twin Oaks Valley Road where he failed to stop for the red light and headed southbound on 
Twin Oaks Valley Road.  At Craven Drive, Ebert veered into the northbound lanes of South Twin Oaks 
Valley Road and continued southbound until turning eastbound onto Village Drive. We terminated the 
pursuit, turning off our overhead lights, following the vehicle at a safe distance.  Ebert was observed 
turning eastbound onto Wandering Way, southbound onto Savona Lane, eastbound onto Garland 
Avenue and finally northbound onto Custer Avenue. The vehicle pursuit lasted approximately 2.1 miles 
and approximately 3 minutes. Throughout the pursuit, Ebert drove at high rates of speed, up to 82 miles 
per hour on the freeway and 60 miles per hour on surface streets. Ebert made numerous unsafe lane 
changes and drove on the wrong side of a divided roadway.

At the dead end of Custer Avenue, Ebert exited the vehicle and fled on foot. Since Ebert did not place 
the vehicle's transmission into park, it rolled back into the lead patrol vehicle. The patrol vehicle suffered 
minor damage to the front end. Traffic Deputy, Corporal Guerrero (0817) investigated the collision (see 
Case #23177566 for details). 
 
Deputy Druda (0639) began a foot pursuit and followed Ebert who climbed the fence on the side of the 
house located 877 Custer Avenue. Deputy Druda went through the gate and as he attempted to 
apprehend Ebert, a use of force ensued (see Deputy Druda's officer report). Corporal Maldonado came 
to assist Deputy Druda and was also involved in the use of force (see Corporal Maldonado's officer 
report). Deputy Haggerty (4097) and Deputy Manibusan (0640) assisted detaining Ebert (see Deputy 
Haggerty's officer report and Deputy Manibusan's officer report). During the use of force, Deputy Druda 
suffered redness and swelling to his left knee. Deputy Maldanado sustained redness and bruising to his 
right knee. Deputy Manibusan sustained scratches, redness, and minor bruising to his right forearm and 
wrist. Ebert suffered a laceration above his left eye, a fracture to his left cheek bone, an abrasion to his 
nose and two cuts to his right wrist. 
 
 
San Marcos Fire Department Engine #141 and RA #141 responded to the scene and transported Ebert 
to Palomar Medical Center for evaluation. 
 
Deputy Druda contacted the register owner of the stolen vehicle and released the vehicle to the owner at 
the scene. Deputy Druda contacted Stolen Vehicle System and removed the vehicle as stolen. A records 
check indicated the vehicle was stolen out of the city of San Diego on 06/17/2023. California Highway 
Patrol took the initial stolen vehicle report 
. Deputy Salazar photographed the 
recovered vehicle and of Deputy Druda and Deputy Manibusan.  
 
At Palomar Medical Center, I admonished Ebert per my deputy notebook and Ebert provided the 
following statement: 
 
STATEMENTS: 
 
STATEMENT OF BRENT EBERT: 
 
Ebert said he got the vehicle from his friend
, earlier today. Ebert became uncooperative and did not 
provide any further details. 
 
 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUED: 
 
Ebert was medically cleared by the Palomar Medical Center staff. While at the hospital Deputy Vicencio 
took photographs of Ebert.

REPORT NARRATIVE
ORIGIN:

 

 

On 07/01/2023 at 1948 hours, Carlsbad Police broadcasted a Be On the Lookout (BOL) for a stolen 1997 Ford F-150
(CA(@Gym) that was seen driving eastbound into the city of San Marcos, San Diego County.

On 07/01/2023 at about 1951 hours, San Marcos Patrol Deputies located the stolen vehicle and attempted to initiate a traffic
stop at the 700 Block of West San Marcos Boulevard, in the city of San Marcos. The driver failed to yield to deputies and a
traffic pursuit was initiated. The traffic pursuit came to a stop at the dead end near 877 Custer Avenue, in the city of San
Marcos. The driver of the vehicle fled on foot, a foot pursuit was initiated, and a use of force ensued to effect an arrest and
prevent further escape (CAD E8631935).

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS:

The following is a summary of my investigation and is not intended to place recordings of the incident. For exact narrative and
statements, refer to my body worn camera (BWC) footage.

Moments prior to the foot pursuit, | observed an unknown male adult exit from the driver's side position of the stolen F-150.
The driver, who had already committed multiple felonies (10851(A)CVC & 2800.2CVC), fled on foot toward the side of a
residence at the dead end of Custer Avenue. As | pursued the fleeing felon on foot toward the side yard of the residence, |
observed a black truck parked in the driveway. | yelled at the suspect to ""Get on the fucking ground” multiple times and the
suspect continued to flee toward a wooden side gate that led into the backyard of the residence. Due to the time of day and
the truck observed in the driveway, | believed the residents were home and the suspect may have tried running into their
residence.

The suspect continued to flee despite my commands and proceeded to jump over the closed gate that led into the backyard. I 
observed the suspect fall headfirst over the five-to-six-foot tall gate and briefly lost observation of him for about two to three 
seconds. Based off my training and experience, fleeing felons and vehicle thieves are known to carry firearms or deadly 
weapons, and will use physical force against law enforcement to avoid being arrested. I caught up to the wooden gate and 
pushed it open and regained visual observation of the suspect. I observed the suspect roll onto his back and use his feet to 
kick me to prevent me from gaining control of him. I used my bodyweight to prevent him from continuing to kick at me and felt 
him grab onto my gear near the right side of my waist where my firearm was holstered. I continued to yell ""Get on the fucking 
ground"" as he pulled on me and attempted to stand up. He continued to grip onto my gear and pull me closer to his body. 
 
To prevent the suspect from gaining control of me or any of my issued gear, to include a deadly weapon, I used a closed fist 
with my right hand and punched the suspect in the face four to five times until I felt him release his hand from my gear. I 
attempted to gain control of the suspect's left arm with my hands to roll him onto his stomach and place him in handcuffs. The 
suspect continued resist by interlocking his left hand to his right arm above his head. He asked, ""Why are you fucking 
punching me man"" and I stated, ""Because you're grabbing my fucking waist."" He continued to grip onto his right arm with his 
left hand and I used my left hand and punched him in the arm one time, which caused him to release his right arm and 
allowed me to gain complete control of his left arm. 
 
Additional Deputies arrived to assist, and we were able to place him in handcuffs without further incident. The suspect was 
immediately rolled into the recovery position and escorted to the street to be evaluated by paramedics. He was identified as 
Brent Ebert 
) by a Deputy on scene. Ebert has an extensive criminal history to include the following charges: 
 
.  
 
Force was necessary to prevent Ebert from escape; self-defense; and to prevent him from possibly running into an occupied 
residence or backyard which could have resulted in injury to innocent bystanders. Due to the time of day and warm summer 
weather, there was a likelihood that the residence had an open backdoor or window, which Ebert could have entered through. 
The force used was effective and ultimately resulted in safely detaining him in handcuffs and preventing further injury to 
Deputies or bystanders.  
 
During the physical altercation, I sustained a scuff with redness on my left knee, a scratch on my right elbow, and pain to my 
right hand. Medical treatment was not necessary for my injuries. Ebert had apparent bleeding from his face, which was 
unknown to have resulted from him falling headfirst over the five to six foot gate or because of the necessary force used 
against him. Ebert was transported to Palomar Medical Center for further medical evaluation and treatment.

REPORT NARRATIVE
ORIGIN:

 

On 7/1/23 at 1948 hours, Carlsbad Police (CBPD) broadcasted a Be on the Lookout (BOL) for a stolen white 1997 Ford F-150
(CA/LIC 4) that was seen driving eastbound into the city of San Marcos in the County of San Diego.

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATION AND ACTIONS:

On 7/1/23, at about 1951 hours, deputies located the occupied stolen vehicle driving eastbound on San Marcos Boulevard in
the City of San Marcos. A traffic enforcement stop was initiated, and the driver failed to yield which initiated a traffic pursuit.
Deputy Druda #0639 and | were directly behind the stolen vehicle when the traffic pursuit came to an end at a Cul-de-Sac of
877 Custer Avenue. | observed Deputy Druda dynamically exit his patrol vehicle and run after the male subject, later identified
as Brent Ebert (@y@y), towards a residence. | exited my vehicle and attempted to catch up to both as | was in fear that Ebert
may attempt to run into someone's residence or backyard or attack Deputy Druda. As | ran past the stolen vehicle, | observed
the vehicle roll backwards into Deputy Druda’'s patrol vehicle. | quickly glanced and did not see any other subjects in the
vehicle. As | turned the corner of the residence, | observed Deputy Druda and Ebert fighting on the ground. As | got closer, |
could see Ebert flailing his legs towards Deputy Druda and attempting to grab his duty gear on his vest. At one point, Ebert
had a hold of Deputy Druda's vest with one hand and was trying to stand up. | yelled ""Hey. Get on the ground,"" and used both
of my hands to push Ebert towards the ground to get him off Deputy Druda. | could hear Deputy Druda yell, ""Get off my waist,”
so | used my right forearm and elbow to strike Ebert in the face. | believed Ebert was trying to pull Deputy Druda to the ground
and trying to gain control of one of Deputy Druda's force options such as his taser, OC spray, baton, or firearm. Once | saw
Ebert had let go of Deputy Druda, | used both of my hands to pin down his left arm. Once deputies were able to roll Ebert onto
his stomach, | used my upper body to apply downward pressure to his upper back to prevent him from getting up. | noticed
Ebert's arm was tucked under his body, so | got off his back which allowed deputies to gain control of his right arm. | used my
right knee to apply downward pressure to his back to allow the deputies to detain him in handcuffs. While controlling Ebert, |

told him to ""Stop resisting."" Once deputies conducted their pat down, I assisted Ebert to the recovery position. Once deputies 
assisted Ebert to his feet and moved him out of the backyard of a residence, I took digital photographs of the scene.  
 
Had I not used force, I believed Ebert would have continued to attack my partners or me. This force was effective as it freed 
Deputy Druda from being grappled by Ebert and it allowed us to safely detain Ebert preventing him from attacking me and my 
partners.  
 
That ended my contact with Ebert.

REPORT NARRATIVE
ORIGIN:

 

 

On 07/01/2023, at 1948 hours, Carlsbad Police broadcasted a Be On the Lookout (BOL) for a stolen 1997 Ford F-150
(CAGE) that was seen driving eastbound into the city of San Marcos. San Marcos Patrol Deputies located the stolen
vehicle and attempted to initiate a traffic stop at the 700 Block of West San Marcos Boulevard. The driver failed to yield to
deputies and a traffic pursuit was initiated in San Marcos. The traffic pursuit came to a stop at the dead end of 877 Custer
Avenue, in the city of San Marcos. The driver of the vehicle fled on foot, a foot pursuit was initiated, and a use of force ensued
to effect an arrest and prevent further escape. (CAD#E8631935)

DEPUTY'S OBSERVATIONS/ACTIONS:

The following is a summary of my investigation and is not indented to replace recordings of the incident. For exact narrative
and statements, refer to body worn camera footage.

| arrived on scene and immediately observed Deputies foot pursuing a male later identified as Brent Ebert (ayy. | exited
my vehicle and started to follow my partners on foot. The foot pursuit ended near the side gate of 877 Cluster Avenue with
Deputies attempting to detain Brent on the ground. | saw Brent actively resisting and attempting to kick Deputies. Brent used
his legs to kick and flail his body towards Deputies. Brent refused to give his hands to be handcuffed by Deputies. Brent
turned his body and attempted to stand up while Deputies held him on the ground.

 

| used both of my hands to grab and pull Brent's legs and shirt in order to place him in the prone position. | gave him verbal
commands to ""to put your hands behind your back"" and ""give me your right hand.” Brent continued to refuse by tucking his
right hand into his body and not comply to verbal commands given by Deputies. | applied downward pressure with my body to
maintain control of Brent's legs and lower back while he was on the ground. | assisted Deputy Haggerty (4097) with placing
handcuffs on Brent by grabbing his right wrist and elbow to maintain control of him.

Had I not used force, I believed Brent could have escaped, caused great bodily injury to others, and grab a weapon to use 
against myself and other Deputies. The forced used was necessary to effect an arrest and prevent escape.  
 
Due to the use of force, I sustained scratches, redness, and minor bruising to my right forearm and wrist. I declined medical 
attention.

June 16, 2024 Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) – Update #1 
 
On June 16, 2024, at approximately 9:00 a.m., Fremont Police Officers responded to a carjacking in 
the parking lot of a store on the 44000 block of Osgood Road. The suspect was armed with a knife 
and left the scene prior to officers’ arrival. A short time later, an officer located a male subject 
nearby who matched the description of the carjacking suspect. The suspect was still armed with a 
knife and walking on Automall Parkway just west of Osgood Rd. The officer directed the suspect to 
stop. The suspect brandished the knife at the officer and advanced toward him.  Despite numerous 
commands to stop, and the officer repositioning to create space and distance, the suspect 
continued to advance toward the officer while holding the knife. The officer discharged his service 
weapon, striking the suspect once. Officers on scene rendered medical aid to the suspect, who was 
subsequently transported to an area hospital. The suspect is currently in stable condition.  No 
officers were injured in this event. 
 
Involved Fremont Police Officer: Officer Jonathan Laforteza, two years of service in law 
enforcement, with almost a year of service with the Fremont Police Department.  Officer Laforteza 
is assigned to patrol. 
 
Suspect: Sean Patrick McMahan, 31 years old, out of Fremont.   
 
The Fremont Police Department Crime Against Persons Unit is investigating this incident. It remains 
an active and ongoing investigation.  In the coming days, additional cases involving criminal charges 
against the suspect will be presented to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office.   
 
Fremont Police Department is currently developing an in‐depth, detailed release of information, to 
include body-worn camera video, store surveillance video, and evidence of the related crimes. This 
information is anticipated to be available and released in the near future. 
 
Anyone who witnessed the incident or with information regarding the incident, please contact 
Detective Michael Gebhardt at mgebhardt@fremont.gov or by calling our Investigations Unit at

NARRATIVE
Source:
On 12-29-23, at about 0038 hours, I heard Deputy Loredo (#4103) broadcast via FSO radio he was in pursuit of a 
white Lexus in the area of Lac Jac Ave. and Manning Ave. (Fresno County). I assisted on the pursuit at about 
Manning Ave. and Bethel Ave.
Victim Statement:
None.
Witness Statement:
None.
Investigation:
On the above date and time, I was assigned to area 3 patrol as a Deputy Sheriff K-9 handler, partnered with my 
Sheriff’s service dog “Roy”. I was driving a fully marked Fresno County Sheriff’s patrol/K9 vehicle (#1817) and 
wearing a Fresno County Sheriff Office (Class C) uniform.
While on patrol I heard Deputy Loredo broadcast he was attempting to catch up to a white Lexus for running a stop 
sign. Deputy Loredo shortly after advised he was in pursuit of the Lexus as it was failing to yield. Deputy Loredo 
broadcasted updates to the pursuit and at times stated the Lexus travelled at speeds in excess of 100mph all while 
running numerous posted stop signs. Fresno Sheriff helicopter ""Eagle one"" was responded and took over broadcast 
of the pursuit.
At about Bethel Ave. and Manning Ave. I observed the described white Lexus travelling northbound on Bethel Ave. 
and then made an eastbound turn onto Manning Ave. I began to trail the Lexus as it continued at a high rate of 
speed eastbound on Manning Ave.
At about Manning Ave. and Newmark Ave. I observed a Reedley PD officer deploy stop sticks as the road bottle 
necked due to a construction zone. I observed the driver of the Lexus make a northbound turn onto J St.
As I turned onto J St. I lost sight of the vehicle. ""Eagle one"" broadcasted the vehicle had ""blacked out."" I then 
observed brake lights in the far distance. The Lexus continued through the residential roadways on the incorporated 
city streets of Parlier. The Lexus continued to travel at a high rate of speed while continuing through posted stop 
signs.

I observed the Lexus make an eastbound turn onto Tulare St. traversing through the residential roadways of Parlier. 
The driver of the Lexus once again continuing through posted stop signs. ""Eagle one"" broadcasted the Lexus had 
now made a northbound turn onto the major roadway which was Zediker Ave. As I turned onto Zediker Ave. I 
observed the Lexus's taillights in the far distance. I trailed the Lexus as it made a westbound turn onto Adams Ave. 
once again continuing through multiple posted stop signs on county roads.
At about Adams Ave. and Del Rey Ave. the Lexus began to slow as I observed the Lexus lose a passenger side tire. 
Deputy Loredo and I re-engaged and attempted to stop the vehicle by activating our emergency lights and siren. Our 
emergency lighting equipment consisted of a steady forward facing red light. The driver of the Lexus then drove 
south onto Del Rey Ave. followed by an eastbound turn into multiple mature orange orchards. While driving through 
the orange orchards at a high rate of speed the branches and oranges on the trees knocked both my driver and 
passenger side spotlights off my patrol vehicle.
In the orchard I lost visual of the vehicle due to the driver's erratic driving. However, ""Eagle one"" maintained visual. 
The driver eventually stopped and fled from the Lexus on foot. ""Eagle one"" was overhead and followed the driver as 
the suspect ran through the orchard. A perimeter was quickly set by assisting deputies and Reedley PD officers.
At about 0101 hours, K9 announcements were made by deputies utilizing a PA (public address system) from patrol 
vehicles. ""Eagle one"" also made PA announcements into the orchard for the driver to surrender. ""Eagle one"" advised 
the suspect was making his way through the orchard in a northbound direction. The suspect was about 30 rows 
south of Adams Ave. ""Eagle one"" later advised they last observed the suspect in the third row south of Adams Ave. 
and he may have attempted to conceal himself. It shall be noted patrol units were on Adams Ave. directly north of the 
suspect's location with emergency lighting equipment activated. This possibly caused him to conceal himself rather 
than to continue to evade by flight.
Deputy O'Donnell (#11491) utilized his department issued drone and located a possible location for the suspect in 
the third row as described by ""Eagle one."" I viewed Deputy O'Donnell's screen and gained a visual representation 
and aerial view of the orchard. I observed patrol units directly north of the hot spot's location. Deputy O'Donnell 
advised he would utilize the drone's spotlight to help deputies gauge the suspect's location.
At about 0112 hours, I formulated a search team and began a search from a dirt easement westbound into the 
orchard. The search team consisted of Deputy North (#11309), Deputy H. Sims (#11545), Reedley PD Sgt. Rivera, 
and my K9 partner ""Roy"" and I. ""Roy"" was secured to a 30 ft leash.
At the start of the search I announced, ""Sheriff's Office you need to surrender now, we'll be searching with a dog."" As 
we continued the search I again announced, ""Fresno County Sheriff Office K9 unit, come out now with your hands 
up, we'll be searching with a dog when he finds you he will bite you."" This announcement was given twice throughout 
the search. Given my repeated announcements we received no response.
Deputy North pointed out movement into one of the orange trees. At this point ""Roy"" had not alerted to the suspect's 
presence. A plan was devised that Deputy North and Deputy H. Sims would search under the mature orange tree 
where it was believed the suspect had concealed themselves.
Shortly after Deputy North and Deputy H. Sims entered underneath the tree I heard them commanding the suspect 
to show them their hands. I stood in the orchard row and ordered the suspect, ""surrender or you're going to get bit."" I 
then heard Deputy North exclaim, ""he's fighting!""
Due to the suspect continuing to resist arrest and refusing to surrender peacefully, I elected to deploy my K9 partner 
“Roy”, based on the following officer safety reasons:
The suspect was wanted for VC 2800.2(a), a felony.
The suspect was wanted for PC 148(a)(1), a misdemeanor.
The suspect was actively and physically resisting arrest.

The suspect was now wanted for PC 69, a felony.
The suspect had not been searched and it was unknown if he was armed with improvised or conventional 
weapons.
The use of the K9 could likely reduce the chance for a prolonged physical altercation, preventing potential 
significant injury to the suspect and/or the search team.
The suspect had displayed no regard for the safety of the public or deputies as he erratically fled from law 
enforcement during the course of the pursuit.
With ""Roy"" secured to a leash I entered under the tree and observed the suspect's hands to be unsecured as he laid 
on the ground with deputies struggling to gain control of him. I led ""Roy"" to the suspect and gave ""Roy"" his bite 
command in effort to gain compliance. ""Roy"" engaged the suspect on his lower left leg. While ""Roy"" was engaged 
with the suspect I ordered him to stop fighting and to give us his hands. Assisting deputies were able to gain control 
of his hands and place him in handcuffs ""Roy"" was given his out command and removed him from the bite.
I immediately notified FSO Dispatch of the K9 application and requested EMS personnel respond to the scene.
I walked ""Roy"" back to my patrol vehicle and secured him in the backseat cage. The suspect, later identified as 
Roberto Jaime Barajas (DOB: 10-14-74) by prior booking photograph, was transported to CRMC for further 
evaluation.
Deputy Loredo followed EMS as they transported Roberto to CRMC. I met with Deputy Loredo and Roberto in 
""trauma hall B."". I spoke to Roberto and conducted a civil liability interview. An audio recording of the interview was 
later booked into Evidence at FSO Headquarters.
I took digital photographs of Roberto’s injury. I observed Roberto to have five lacerations about 2-3 inches in length 
on his lower left leg. I observed Roberto to have an elongated abrasion on his inner left bicep. This injury was likely 
not the result of the K9 application as I did not observe ""Roy"" to engage either of Roberto's arms. I later uploaded the 
digital photographs to EzEvidence.
I spoke to Doctor 
 who evaluated and treated Roberto. I asked Dr. 
 if Roberto's injuries were 
consistent with a dog bite, and she stated it was. I asked Dr. 
 if Roberto's injuries were life threatening and 
she stated, ""no.""
Roberto was left with Deputy Loredo at CRMC pending clearance from medical staff. Roberto was later booked for 
violation of VC 2800.2(a), PC 148(a)(1), PC 69, and PC 1203.2(a).
Roberto has prior arrest history for violation of VC 2800.2(a), and PC 148(a)(1).
K9 Sgt. Gattie (#0063) was on scene and notified of the use of force.
I later obtained the recording from ""Eagle one"" and booked a copy into Evidence at FSO Headquarters.

SOURCE: On December 29, 2023 at about 0038 hours, I attempted to conduct an enforcement stop on a white 
sedan for vehicle code violation 22450(a), failure to stop at stop sign at the intersection of Adams Avenue and Lac 
Jac Avenue. The vehicle failed to yield and a pursuit ensued.
VICTIM STATEMENT: None.
WITNESS STATEMENT: None.
INVESTIGATION: On the above date and time, I was working uniformed patrol and driving a marked Fresno County 
Sheriff's patrol vehicle. At the time, I was traveling north on Lac Jac Avenue approaching Adams Avenue, County of 
Fresno, when I observed a vehicle traveling east on Adams Avenue approaching Lac Jac. As the vehicle approached 
the intersection, I saw that it failed to come to a stop at a posted stop sign. This intersection as clearly posted stop 
signs for traffic traveling east and west on Adams Avenue.
As the vehicle turned south onto Lac Jac, I turned and began following the vehicle. As I followed, I noticed that the 
vehicle began traveling at a high rate of speed. I began attempting to catch up to the vehicle and saw that I was 
traveling at 100 miles per hour and was not gaining on the vehicle. I then activated my overhead emergency lights, 
which included a solid forward facing red light, to conduct the enforcement stop for the traffic violation. The vehicle 
failed to yield and continued south on Lac Jac. I then activated my siren and informed Dispatch that I was now in 
pursuit.
As the vehicle reached the intersection of Lac Jac and Manning, the driver of the vehicle failed to come to a stop at a 
circular red light. This intersection is controlled by traffic lights for all traffic and the light was red for south bound 
traffic on Lac Jac. The vehicle continued south on Lac Jac at a high rate of speed until it arrived at the intersection of 
Lac Jac and Dinuba Avenue. The vehicle slowed and turned west bound onto Dinuba Avenue. It was at this time I 
was able to obtain a license plate on the vehicle as well as a make. The license plate on the vehicle was identified as 
 and registered to a Lexus 4 door sedan. This make was confirmed by me using the Lexus emblem 
attached to the trunk lid of the vehicle.
I continued to pursue the vehicle west on Dinuba Avenue. The vehicle continued at a high rate of speed. The vehicle 
reached the intersection of Smith and Dinuba. This intersection is a four way stop controlled by posted stop signs. 
The driver of the vehicle failed to come to a stop and continued through the stop sign at a high rate of speed and 
continued west on Dinuba. The next controlled intersection was Zediker Avenue where there are posted stop signs 
for east and west bound traffic. There are not stops for south and north bound traffic. The driver of the vehicle again 
failed to stop at the posted stop sign and continued through the stop sign.
I continued following the vehicle which continued to travel at over 100 miles per hour to the following intersection of 
Dinuba And Mendocino Avenue. This intersection has posted stop signs for traffic traveling east and west bound on 
Dinuba Avenue. There are not stops for traffic traveling north and south on Mendocino. At this time, the vehicle had 
gained distance of almost 1/2 miles ahead of me. As I kept visual of the vehicle, Fresno County Sheriff's air support 
unit, Eagle 1 arrived overhead and obtained visual of the vehicle.
The vehicle had reached the intersection of Dinuba and Academy. This intersection is a four way stop intersection 
and the driver of the vehicle failed to come to a stop at this intersection. As Eagle 1 advised they had visual of the 
vehicle, I deactivated my emergency lights and siren and discontinued my pursuit but continued to follow at a 
distance. The vehicle continued west on Dinuba Avenue to the intersection of Dinuba and Bethel where the vehicle 
made a north bound turn onto Bethel. The vehicle continued north on Bethel until reaching Manning Avenue where 
the vehicle turned east onto Manning.
I continued following the vehicle as well as several other assisting Deputies. The vehicle continued east on Manning 
Avenue entering the city of Parlier. Reedley PD assisted by placing spikes near the intersection of Manning and 
Newmark. We were informed by Reedley that the spikes were successful. The vehicle then turned north on K Street

to Tuolumne. The vehicle turned east on Tuolumne to Zediker where it turned north bound. The vehicle continued 
north on Zediker to Adams Avenue where it turned west on Adams. The driver arrived at the intersection of Newmark 
and Adams where the driver failed to stop at a posted stop sign. We continued to follow the vehicle as Eagle 1 
continued to maintain visual overhead. The vehicle then came to the intersection of Academy Avenue and Adams 
Avenue. The driver again failed to come to a stop at a posted stop sign at this intersection. The following intersection 
was Bethel Avenue which is also a controlled intersection with posted stop signs. The driver of the vehicle again 
failed to stop at the stop sign and continued west on Adams Avenue.
It was at this time that the vehicle began slowing which allowed myself and assisting Deputies to gain distance on the 
vehicle. Due to being able to gain on the vehicle and the fact that the speed was slowing, I re-engaged my 
emergency lights and siren. Eagle 1 was still overhead maintaining visual. The vehicle then turned south on Del Rey 
Avenue from Adams and traveled about 200 yards before entering into an orange orchard east of Del Rey Avenue. 
Myself and Deputy M. Perez followed the vehicle into the orchard while assisting Deputies began setting a perimeter 
around the orchard.
We continued pursuing the vehicle through the orchard where we lost visual as the vehicle turned back west in the 
orchard. Eagle 1 continued to maintain visual of the vehicle and provided updates as to the location and direction. 
Eagle 1 informed us that the vehicle had come to a stop and the driver had exited and was running north in the 
orchard. Eagle 1 maintained visual of the subject and was able to direct Deputies to the location of the subject. The 
subject was then taken into custody.
Due to injuries sustained by the subject during his arrest, he was transported to CRMC for medical treatment. The 
subject was identified as Roberto Barajas Jaime, dob 10-14-1974, using his California Identification card.
While at CRMC, I read Roberto his Miranda Rights from my department issued Miranda card. Roberto informed me 
that he understood his rights and agreed to speak with me.
Roberto was asked where he had been prior to being contacted by Deputies. Roberto told me he had been in Fresno 
where he had been trying to sell his Lexus. Roberto said he met with a black male at a car wash near Kings Canyon 
and Chestnut Avenue. The male had agreed to purchase the vehicle and Roberto said he told the male to drive him 
home to Parlier. Roberto said while driving back to Parlier, the male began acting strange. They were traveling south 
on Golden State Blvd when the male told him he was going to take his money and his car.
Roberto said they turned east onto Adams Avenue from Golden State Blvd and drove to the intersection of Del Rey 
and Adams.
Roberto said when they reached the intersection of Adams and Del Rey he as able to exit the vehicle onto the 
roadway of Del Rey and then ran into the orchard where he hid until he was contacted by Deputies.
Roberto insisted that he was telling me the truth and had no reason to lie. I then began to tell Roberto that I had been 
following the vehicle since the area of Adams and Lac Jac and had my lights and siren activated. Roberto denied 
being followed and stated he was not in the vehicle. I then informed Roberto that the vehicle had been followed by 
the helicopter since the area of Academy and Dinuba Avenue and maintained visual then entire time. I informed 
Roberto that a person was seen exiting the driver side of the vehicle and followed to the exact location where he was 
contacted.
Roberto continued to deny he had been driving the vehicle and could not explain how we were directed to his 
location by Deputies in the helicopter. I informed Roberto that I believed he was not being truthful and discontinued 
my interview.
Prior to speaking with Roberto, I contacted Deputy Norby who was the observer in Eagle 1 and confirmed that the 
subject contacted by Deputies was the person seen exiting the driver side of the vehicle.

NARRATIVE
SOURCE:
On 12/29/2023, at about 0039 hours, I assisted Deputy J. Loredo who was in pursuit at S Lac Jac Ave. and E 
Manning Ave.
VICTIM STATEMENT (S):
None.
WITNESS STATEMENT (S):
None.
INVESTIGATION:
I assisted to Deputy Loredo and arrived at the termination point of the pursuit at E Adams Ave. and S Del Rey Ave.
I heard over the radio that the suspect had ran from the vehicle and was hiding in the orchard on the south east 
corner of the above intersection.
Deputy R. Odonnell and Eagle One both advised the suspect was contained and possibly hiding in a tree 3 rows 
south of Adams Ave. between a dirt road and Del Rey Ave.
I met with Deputy M. Perez at the intersection of the dirt road and Adams Ave. Deputy Perez was leading a K9 
search team to locate and apprehend the suspect. The search team consisted of me, Deputy Perez, Deputy Perez's 
K9 partner, Deputy H. Sims, and a Reedley PD Officer.
We searched westbound into the orchard utilizing the dirt path between the second and third rows south of Adams 
Ave.
Eagle One advised the suspect was approximately 100 yards into the row, and Deputy Odonnell had his drone 
spotlight on the area the suspect was seen hiding.
Deputy M. Perez gave multiple K9 announcements as we continued down the row. Once we were close to the 
suspected area, he gave a loud announcement requesting the suspect's surrender.
Eagle One advised us the suspect was in a tree within 2 trees of our location. The search team stopped and let the 
K9 search the area and he showed interest in a tree two trees to our west, at this time I observed the branches of the 
same tree move higher than the K9 could have touched. I advised Deputy Perez of the movement I observed.
The K9 did not alert but appeared to be searching the area directly below the tree that we suspected which led me to 
believe the suspect was too high in the tree for the K9 to reach. We devised a plan to attempt to search the tree by 
hand and force his surrender.

Deputy Sims and I located the suspect about 5 feet off the ground in the tree. The suspect was hiding his hands and 
was still trying to hide. Deputy Sims asked him what he had in his hands multiple times.
Considering the following factors, I chose to attempt to force the suspect out of the tree:
The suspect posed an immediate threat to deputies as he just led Deputies on a pursuit that reached speeds 
over 100 MPH.
The suspect ran from the vehicle and was hiding while concealing his hands
We had 4 law enforcement officers and a K9 in the immediate area
The suspect was given dozens of announcements by voice, Vehicle PA system, and Eagle One's PA system
It was unknown at the time if the suspect was under the influence of drugs or alcohol
The suspect did not seem to be mentally impaired as he just drove at over 100 MPH and ran from a vehicle
The suspect gave no signs of not understanding how to comply with commands
The suspect was not searched and had a sweater and baggy pants on which could conceal weapons
The suspect had not been restrained
I had a Department issued Monadnock collapsible baton and OC Spray at my disposal
The suspect was wanted for VC 2800.2 (vehicle pursuit with wanton disregard for public safety)
I considered my training and experience with suspects hiding in elevated positions
I considered the possibility of injuries to deputies on scene and the public if the suspect was not immediately 
apprehended
The suspect had already attempted to evade arrest by flight twice
The risk of the suspect escaping would put the public in danger
The apparent need for immediate control of the subject and prompt resolution of the situation
I had never contacted the suspect before
Based on these factors, I grabbed the suspect by his sweater and pulled him out of the tree. As the suspect was 
falling out of the tree, he swung his right hand back with a closed fist and struck me in the right side of my face in 
violation of PC 69.
The suspect hit the ground and I delivered one elbow strike to his upper right shoulder blade. The suspect 
immediately hid his right hand under his body and started flailing all his other limbs in what appeared to be an 
attempt to assault myself and Deputy Sims. I advised Deputy Perez the suspect was fighting us.
Deputy Sims yelled at the suspect to give us his hands and to put them behind his back multiple times without 
success. Deputy Perez then utilized his K9 (see Supplemental #1 for further information).
The suspect immediately put his hands behind his back and surrendered after the K9 application. Deputy Sims and I 
took the suspect into custody and walked him to a patrol car.
The suspect was later identified as Robert Barajas Jaime (10/14/1974). Neither Robert or I had any injuries from the 
strikes traded.
I then assisted Deputy E. Colegio in locating the suspect vehicle. He located it approximately 50 orchard rows south 
of Adams Ave.
I photographed the vehicle (LP: 
) which was a White Lexus Sedan. I searched the vehicle and located a 
case of Modelo beer, and $35 dollars cash both of which were left in the vehicle.
The vehicle was towed by Michael's Automotive pursuant to VC 22651(h).
I later uploaded the photographs to Ez-Evidence.
I took no further action.

NARRATIVE
Source:
On Friday, 12/29/2023, at about 0105 hours, I self-initiated to assist deputies in the area of Bethel Ave. and Adams 
Ave., in the County of Fresno. I arrived on scene at about 0107 hours and assisted deputies conducting a search.
Victim Statement:
See assisting deputies report for further information.
Witness Statement:
None.
Investigation:
On Friday, 12/29/2023, I arrived on scene and assisted Deputy M. Perez (ID: 11366), Deputy J. North (ID: 11309) 
and an assisting Reedley PD officer.
It should be noted I was working uniformed patrol wearing a department approved class ""B"" uniform. Deputy M. 
Perez advised he would be conducting a search with his K9 and requested an additional unit. I then assisted.
Eagle 1 advised they had a heat signature for the subject located about 100 yards into the orchard from our starting 
location in a dirt road extension, parallel to Adams Ave.
While conducting a westbound search into the orchard, I overheard Deputy M. Perez provide multiple K9 
announcements advising the subject to surrender with negative results. We continued searching while Eagle 1 and 
an FSO drone unit lead us to a tree where the suspect was located. We were advised the subject was in a tree an 
unknown amount above the ground. Assisting Deputy J. North advised he saw movement in a tree nearby. Deputy 
North advised that he would search the tree with my assistance. I then located the subject wearing a green shirt 
holding on to the tree with both arms, about five feet off the ground. The subject had his head facing the tree 
attempting to blend in.
Prior to grabbing ahold of the male subject, I shined my flashlight and advised him to show us his hands multiple 
times, with negative results. Myself and assisting Deputy North then grabbed ahold of the male subject and pulled 
him to the ground. Once on the ground, the male subject continued to resist and not allow deputies to grab ahold of 
his hands. I overheard Deputy North stating, ""He's fighting"" while Deputy North and I continued to try to grab ahold of 
the male subject arms and legs that were flailing in an erratic movement. The male subjects arms and legs came 
close to striking me, but did not connect with any portion of my body. I continued to order the subject to give me his 
hands multiple times with negative results. Deputy M. Perez then utilized his K9, see assisting Deputy M. Perez 
report for further information.
Once the K9 had been applied, the male subject immediately placed his hands behind his back and was detained in 
handcuffs. The male subject was later identified as Robert Jaime (DOB: 10/14/1974). I escorted the male subject out

2312-2698
NARRATIVE
DETAILS:
On 12/29/2023 I responded to Circle K East, 1421 E Ocean Avenue, to assist Officer 
Newton with a robbery investigation.
I arrived on scene and was directed to attempt fingerprint lifts from several areas where the 
suspect touched with bare hands.
COUNTER OF REGISTER:
The counter area where the to be purchased items are typically scanned for sale, is a flat 
surface. I was told by Officer Newton that the suspect, when he went behind the counter to 
the cash register, put his hand down on the counter when trying to get into the register. 
After applying a coat of fingerprint dust to the surface of the counter, I found that it was 
mostly fingerprint free and looked to have streaks across it as if recently cleaned. There 
was a palm and fingerprints in the exact area Officer Newton advised the suspect touched. I 
lifted these prints and booked them as evidence later. The palm prints were divided to a left 
and right side of the palm print.
REFRIGERATOR OF BEER COOLER:
Officer Newton advised that the suspect is seen grabbing the handle to open the beer 
cooler along the north wall of the store. He opened the fridge and took out two Natural Ice 
beers. I applied dust to the handle and lifted a set of prints that were located throughout the 
handle.
All lifted prints were booked into evidence.

NARRATIVE
DETAILS
On Friday, December 29, 2023, at approximately 0140 hrs, I received a call from Detective 
Sergeant Vincent Magallon. Sgt. Magallon advised me of a fatal Officer Involved Shooting 
(OIS) that had occurred where the suspect, who would later be identified as Connor Amador 
was shot dead after being involved in an armed robbery of a Circle K Gas 
Station/convenience store that is located at 1421 E Ocean Ave, Lompoc CA. Sgt. Magallon 
had very little information to provide me other than no officers had been injured. Sgt. 
Magallon asked I respond to the scene to assist in the investigation.
When I arrived on scene, I made contact with Sgt. A. White and Sgt. V. Magallon. Sgt. 
White was the patrol watch commander/supervisor when the Officer Involved Shooting 
(OIS) occurred. Sgt. Magallon said Officer T. Newton had been the initial investigating 
officer but was also one of the officers who was present when the OIS occurred. Sgt. 
Magallon said this armed robbery was unique in the sense that AMADOR had robbed the 
same store twice within about an hour and a half time frame. Sgt. Magallon told me, I would 
be taking over the first robbery investigation and asked Sgt. White to provide me a briefing 
as to what had occurred during the first robbery. The following is a summary of what Sgt. 
White told me.

behind AMADOR, he saw him reach into the right pocket and pull out what he saw and

said after a short period, he saw Lazell and AMADOR walk behind the counter and 
to the second register, where AMADOR demanded at gunpoint that Lazell open the other 
register. Lazell told AMADOR he could not as he did not have the proper code. 
said 
AMADOR became upset and warned Lazell not to fuck with him while pointing the barrel of 
the gun directly at Lazell's face. 
said he heard Lazell again tell AMADOR he did not 
have a code and therefore could not open it.
At one point AMADOR orders him and 
to leave the store, which they both did. 
Once safely outside he called 911 to summon aid.
I asked 
to explain to me what was going through his mind when AMADOR pointed 
the gun at him. 
said he did not know what to do and was unsure if he should fight or 
run. I asked 
if he thought AMADOR intended to kill him. 
 said he did not think 
he would be killed but was more worried about being shot than killed. 
said he was 
not injured in anyway but was still in shock and trying to process what had happened.
After speaking with 
, I drove to the 
 to attempt to contact 
and interview him. I arrived back on scene at approximately 0315 hrs, When I knocked on 
the door of the room where 
was staying. I did not receive an answer. I made one 
more attempt at contacting 
with Sgt, A. White at approximately 0715 hrs. I again 
knocked at the door and received no answer. I left a note on the door identifying who I was 
and that I was trying to contact him for an interview.
Later that morning, Detective Corporal Reyna and I met with 
, the store 
manager to see if she could provide us with a copy of the store security recordings. 
said the store had interior and exterior cameras and knew the entire incident had been 
recorded on their CCTV. The time stamps on the security recordings were verified using the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology, which confirmed the cameras were 
accurate. After looking at the NIST website, we noticed that the time was identical and was

Lazell is heard telling AMADOR he does not have a code for the second register and as a

NARRATIVE
AMADOR approaches Lazell and begins to swear at Lazell again. AMADOR asks Lazell if 
he will be calling the Police. Lazell is hesitant to answer but then tells AMADOR he will be 
calling the Police, but will wait until after he is gone. AMADOR gets very upset and uses the 
bottom of the gun's handle to hit Lazell on the left temple. The hit from the handle causes 
Lazell to stumble back and onto the countertop located behind him. AMADOR walks up to 
him and tells Lazell he will kill him if he calls the police. In an act of desperation, Lazell tells 
AMADOR to just shoot him in the head and point to his forehead. AMADOR seems to get 
confused over what Lazell just told him, and is left speechless for a short time. Once he 
gathers his thoughts, AMADOR again demands he open the second register.
Lazell walks to the second register while AMADOR maintains the gun barrel pressed at 
Lazell's head. When Lazell is unable to unlock the second register, AMADOR tells him he is 
going to kill him. Lazell tells AMADOR to go ahead and kill him and uses his head to push 
the gun AMADOR has pressed against his head back. AMADOR pushes the barrel of the 
gun into Lazell's head repeatedly while Lazell keeps asking him to just kill him by shooting 
him in the head. AMADOR tells Lazell he is lucky and continues to slide the chamber back 
while walking away. Just before AMADOR walks out he warns Lazell to not call the police or 
he will return to kill him.
Lazell waits until AMADOR leaves the store and stands motionless as if trying to process 
everything that just happened. Lazell then is seen running toward the door where he later 
locks it.
The fifth security video file I viewed was labeled ""Register 2"", which does have audio 
and contained the following. 
This security camera is located at the northwest corner of the store and gives a wider view 
of the store including the front doors.
The same chain of events were noted in the fourth security file which has audio.

, that I had been looking to talk to him after I had been told that he had witnessed 
the armed robbery that had occurred on Thursday, 12/28/2023.

witnessed the robbery and would be willing to provide me with a statement.
I used a digital recorder to record 
's statement. I also had 
provide me

Card, which verified his identity. The following is what 
told me.

pulled the slide back. 
said he heard words being said between Lazell and 
AMADOR, but he was not close enough to hear what they were saying. 
said the 
only thing he heard was 
saying, ""You do what you got to do.""
said he saw AMADOR walk behind the counter and saw when Lazell opened the 
register. 
said he was still too far away to hear anything that was being said 
between the two but had been able to see AMADOR taking all the money out of the register 
as he pointed the gun barrel at Lazell. 
said he had only seen AMADOR pointing 
the gun barrel at Lazell's torso. 
said from where he stood he had heard AMADOR 
ask Lazell if there was a safe in the rear room. 
said after not finding the safe, 
AMADOR at gunpoint asked Lazell to unlock the other register. 
said he heard 
when Lazell told AMADOR he could not open the second register being he was still signed 
on to the first register. 
said AMADOR then pointed the gun at Lazell's chest trying 
to get Lazell to open the second register. 
said Lazell continued to tell AMADOR he 
was not able to as he did not have the code. When Lazell was not able to open the second 
register, he saw AMADOR point the gun directly at Lazell's head and ask Lazell if he felt like 
dying today. 
said he and 
 looked at each other in terror not knowing what 
would happen next. 
said AMADOR then looked at him and 
 and told them 
to take what they wanted and leave the store. 
said as they both exited the store, 
told him he would be calling the police.
Seymour said he did not remember if AMADOR had ever pointed the gun at him or Vargas, 
and the only person that he pointed the gun at was Lazell. 
said AMADOR only told 
them to take what they wanted and did not threaten them verbally in any way. 
said 
he was not sure what to expect from what was going on and was not sure if he or 
would get shot. 
said AMADOR's complete focus was directed at Lazell and not at 
them. This concluded my interview of

NARRATIVE
The following incident was captured on Axon body worn camera 
) and was later uploaded 
into the secure database and annotated as evidence.
On Friday, August 5, 2023, while working as a Deputy Sheriff at Santa Rita Jail in my full ""Class-D” 
uniform, which clearly identified me as a Peace Officer, I was detailed to John George Psychiatric 
Pavilion (JGPP) located at 2060 Fairmont Drive in San Leandro, CA to provide security for in custody 
Restrictive housing R/H inmate 
), 
, who had been placed on a W&I 5150 
psychiatric detention hold and admitted in room 
.
I was seated next to room 
 with Deputy M. Claure. Deputy Sullivan was across the hallway 
providing security to another inmate when the following occurred.
At 1910 hours, I saw another JGP patient, 
 
 walking from a recreation area to his room. 
When he was within about 10 feet from us, he suddenly and without provocation, rushed towards 
Deputy Claure and began assaulting her by punching her head. Due to the sudden provocation, I was 
unable to attempt verbal de-escalation and I immediately reacted by attempting to gain control on 
 head to prevent further assault. I felt 
 teeth on the right side of my hand and felt 
pressure as if he was biting me. I immediately moved my hands to his shoulders and used my body 
weight to guided him to the floor using a rear reap throw take down. 
 landed flat on his 
stomach.
I placed my right hand on the back of 
 head and my right knee on his lower back to pin 
 to the floor and avoid him from rolling over to his side and stop his assaultive behavior. I took 
special care to avoid the back, neck and throat area to not impair his breathing. I ordered 
 
several times to place his arms behind his back and he did not comply by continuing to pull his arm 
away from me. I then adjusted my grip and place 
 left arm in an elongated rear wrist lock. 
 continued to resist me during my attempt to place his arms behind his back by trying to pull 
his arm away. The rear wrist lock was eventually effective and I was able to get his arm behind his 
back and he was handcuffed by Deputy Claure.
After 
 was safely handcuffed, I placed my left arm on his left bicep and right hand on his left 
elbow and placed him on his side in the recovery position. He appeared to be conscious and breathing 
without difficulty.

Afterwards, Sergeant Romeril responded and we went to Standford Medical Valley Care Hospital 
where I was diagnosed with a dislocated right pinky finger which required a splint. I believe the injury 
occurred while guiding 
 to the ground because I felt him roll into my hand which bent my finger 
backwards.
This is a supplemental report to Deputy S. Sullivan original report.

NARRATIVE
The following incident was captured on Axon body-worn camera (
) and was later uploaded 
into the secure database and annotated as evidence.
On Friday, August 4th, 2023, while working as a Deputy Sheriff at Santa Rita Jail in my full ""Class-D” 
uniform, which clearly identified me as a Peace Officer, I was detailed to John George Psychiatric 
Pavilion (JGP) located at 2060 Fairmont Drive in San Leandro, CA to provide security for an in-
custody inmate in A-Unit.
At about 1910 hours, I was seated outside room 
 in the hallway with Deputy G. Rodriguez when a 
JGP patient, later identified as 
 
 (PFN: 
, was being escorted from the recreation 
area to his room by JGP staff. I saw 
 look at me and start running toward me unprovoked. It 
should be noted: 
 did not say anything to me or Deputy Rodriguez. Furthermore, I have had no 
past police contacts with 
 ran at me and assaulted me by placing both of his hands around my head and neck area. I 
immediately raised my arms to protect myself and stop the assault. While 
 was assaulting me, 
I felt a strike to my head and face area. Due to the fact that 
 had control of my head and neck 
area, I placed my head down in an attempt to free myself from his grasp. I was able to free my head 
and neck from 
 grasp and used my arms to push 
 away from me and prevent him 
from further assaulting me. Due to the sudden attack, there was no time to attempt verbal de-
escalation. Deputy Rodrguez took 
 down to the ground. I fell to my right side and hit the floor. 
 was on his stomach, continued to his assaultive behavior, and refused to follow Deputy 
Rodriguez’s verbal commands.
Deputy S. Sullivan responded to assist. I attempted to gain control of 
 legs by placing him in 
a figure four leglock. I grabbed 
 right leg with my right hand and grabbed his left leg with my 
left hand. I bent his left leg across his right leg and placed his right leg on top of his left leg. I applied 
downward pressure on his right leg with my upper body to prevent him from kicking. 
 continued 
his assaultive behavior and was attempting to break free from the figure four leg lock.
Once Deputies Rodriguez and Sullivan were able to get his hands behind his back, I placed handcuffs 
on 
 and he was successfully restrained. Once 
 was restrained, I continued to maintain 
control of his legs until he stopped resisting and was placed in the recovery position.

On Monday, July 31, 2023, about 1400 hours, I was working at Santa Rita Jail, assigned to Housing

NARRATIVE
My departmental assigned body worn camera (AXON-
) was activated during the incident, 
which I later uploaded the video footage onto a secured server.
On Monday, July 31, 2023, I was working as a Sergeant assigned to the Santa Rita Jail, located at 
5325 Broder Boulevard in Dublin. I was wearing my Alameda Conty Sheriff’s Office departmental 
issued class ""D"" uniform, which clearly identified me as a Sergeant. I was also assigned to work in 
Housing Unit 2 (HU2), when the following occurred.
About 1400 hours, HU1 deputies advised that they had two inmates who had completed their 
recreation time, but they refused to lock back down into their assign cell. These two inmates were later 
identified as Inmate 
 
 (HU1-
Pod) and Inmate 
 
 (HU1-
Pod). 
 
was assigned to HU1 cell #
 and 
 was assigned to HU1 cell #
. HU1 assigned deputies gave 
 and 
 multiple orders to lockdown, but they refused to comply. Based on the 
circumstances, HU1 assigned supervisor, Sergeant W. Dorshkind requested additional deputies to 
assist with the incident, so I responded.
It should be noted that HU1 is an Administrative Housing Unit which consist of inmates who cannot be 
housed within the general population due to a variety of factors. Classifications considered to be 
Administrative Housing include Restrictive Housing Inmates (RHI), Special Security Inmates, Serious 
Mental Illness Inmates (SMI), Therapeutic Housing Inmates (THIs), Protective Custody, and Protective 
Custody/Behavioral Health Clients (BHC).
Inmate 
 had been classified as a BHC inmate and 
 had been classified as a RHI inmate. 
Both inmates have a long violent history here at the Santa Rita Jail (SRJ), and both inmates are 
deemed dangerous to all staff and other inmates due to their unpredictable violent behaviors. In 
addition, I have personally been involved in multiple debriefs of incidents where both 
 and 
 were identified as suspects of assaults on deputies including gassing, vandalism among other 
crimes.
Upon arrival at the east dayroom, I observed 
 to be pacing back and forth inside of the D Pod 
dayroom and 
 was standing inside of F Pod by the dayroom door. I also noticed that the D Pod 
dayroom door, bottom glass window, had been shattered into pieces.

Based on the circumstances, Sergeant Dorskhind then decided to direct our effort and attempt to 
lockdown 
 first.
I know 
 did not only have a violent history against deputies during his time at SRJ, but he had 
also proven his abilities and his sophistication to assault anyone while being in waist and leg restraints 
in prior incidents (Refer to report #23-006020 for further detail). 
 was currently being placed in 
a Special Inmate Management Plan with Movement in Restraints and Movement in Tandem 
conditions. He is about 6’0” tall, about240 pounds, athletic build and he is without doubt a serious 
threat at SRJ. I also noticed 
 to be wearing multiple layers of clothing, which based on my 
training and experience, I knew it to be a common protection tactic for inmates to utilize when they are 
preparing to engage in a physical altercation against deputies or others.
While standing in the east dayroom, I could smell a distinct spicy type smell and I also observed 
multiple deputies who appeared uncomfortable, were coughing repeatedly, and had bloodshot watery 
eyes. Based on my observation, training and experience, I knew the symptoms and the odor was 
consistent with an Oleoresin Capsicum (OC), Pepper Spray or Tear Gas when deployed.
I was then directed to assist with assembling and staging a contact team inside of C Pod by the C and 
D Pod walk-through door. Deputies C. Vancott, A. Aguilera, Z. DeSouza, C. Cotton, R. Nixon, R. 
Posedel, I. Ceja, and Sergeant M. Ahern responded and assisted with this task. While staging, I 
observed all the above deputies, Sergeant Ahern, and myself to be suffering from the same OC 
symptoms. Throughout the duration of the incident, involved individuals including myself were 
struggling with the OC effects symptoms.
Lieutenants J. Atienza and A. Garth responded and monitored the incident.
Multiple Sergeants and deputies attempted to de-escalate the situation by asking and ordering 
 
to lock back down into his cell, but he continued to ignore their effort and refused to comply.
Later, I relocated to D Pod, and I was standing by the D Pod door, when I observed 
 walking 
upstairs, carrying what appeared to be a small plastic bag in his left hand. 
 walked toward cell 
#
and inserted a partial of the plastic bag through the crack of the cell door frame. Based on 
 behaviors, his prior history of gassing other inmate coupled with my training and experience, 
I knew 
 was gassing the inmate inside of cell #
, who was later identified as 
 
 
with an unknown liquid. 
 and 
 appeared to be yelling at each other prior to and after the 
gassing incident. It was later determined that 
 was uncooperative during the investigation and 
refused to speak with deputies regarding the gassing incident.
Sergeant S. Brandon who was standing by me also attempted to speak with 
 at the D Pod 
dayroom door. Sergeant Brandon calmly asked 
 if he could “cuff-up” or to lock back down, but 
 ignored his presence and request. 
 then approached the door window with both hands 
clenched in an assaultive manner. While approaching the door, 
 refused to acknowledge or 
maintain eye contact with me or Sergeant Brandon. Instead, he gave a blank stare as if he was 
confused and warned us that he would fight deputies if they enter the dayroom.

There were more than 40 minutes of failed de-escalation efforts in order to gain 
 compliance. 
The significant delay to the proper running of the HU included conducting general observation checks 
of D Pod inmates, conducting pill-call, serving dinner, and coupled with other unforeseen emergency 
risks. Based on these factors coupled with other circumstances, it appeared that using force was the 
viable option at the time to detain 
 Therefore, based on the above circumstances coupled with 
 assaultive nature, his high level of sophistication threat, and his intentions to assault 
deputies when they enter the Pod, it was then decided to utilize a Resistive Inmate Management 
(RIM) team. The RIM team appeared to be the safest option for both deputies and 
Once Sergeant M. Bitle approved the decision, the RIM team was then assembled and staged. All 
RIM team deputies were outfitted with protective gear which is similar to a riot type gear. These 
protective outfits are made of hard-shell plastic type materials which are designed to protect deputies 
from blunt force trauma. This protective outfit consists of a helmet, upper body and shoulder/arm 
protection, thigh and groin protection, and knee and shin guard protection. Based on my training and 
experience, I know firsthand from wearing this protective outfit that it can be difficult to move, 
maneuver, work in a hostile/confined environment, and difficult to control an active violent person 
during an evolving situation.
Sergeant Ahern, who provided less-lethal coverage along with the RIM team entered D Pod dayroom 
from the C/D Pod walk-through door. Upon entering, Sergeant Ahern deployed a sting ball grenade in 
his effort to de-escalate the situation with the intention of accomplishing two objectives. First, 
 
would peacefully surrender. Second, was to distract him so it would provide the RIM team a strategic 
position of advantage. However, 
 refused to surrender. Instead, he quickly re-positioned 
himself to the television (TV) area. 
 appeared to be in a fighting stance while taunting deputies 
to fight him. Multiple orders were given by deputies for 
 to comply, but he refused. Based on his 
assaultive and resistive behaviors, the RIM team deputies contacted 
 and attempted to detain 
him by taking him down to the ground which appeared to be effective.
 was on the ground in a prone position with his head towards the TV box. He was also lying on 
the ground between the TV box and the first row of cement benches. The space between the TV box 
and the first row of benches is approximately 5 feet wide. This confined space posed a very limited 
workspace for the 6 heavily outfitted deputies, especially when they were actively trying to control 
 who continued to violently kick his legs at deputies, thrash his body aggressively, tuck both of 
his arms underneath his body, and aggressively move his head as he was going to headbutt deputies. 
Due to 
 continuous movement, few deputies were forced to work from underneath the TV 
box.
During the struggle, Sergeant Ahern deployed his taser in order to stop 
 assaultive behaviors. 
(Refer to Sergeant Ahern’s supplemental report for further detail.)
It was a crowded scene with deputies attempting to grab a hold and to control of 
 legs, body, 
arms, and head. While struggling to control 
 I could see deputies gasp for air while trying to 
catch their breath. I also could hear them coughing violently.
From my position, I noticed Deputy Aguilera who was trying to control 
 left arm, appeared 
fatigued. He was unable to maintain a firm grasp on 
 left arm. Based on my observation

coupled with multiple available deputies on-scene at the time, I believed it was safe for me to direct 
Deputy Nixon to relieve Deputy Aguilera.
Once Deputy Nixon took over, I assisted him by trying to coach him as he attempted to conduct a 2 on 
1 rock out control hold technique. While doing so, I observed Deputy Nixon to be struggling with his 
grasp, he had runny nose, watery bloodshot eyes, and I could also hear him violently coughing. 
During the struggle and without warning, Deputy Nixon started vomiting on himself and 
 
Despite the struggle, Deputy Nixon maintained his grasp on 
 left arm.
Due to the length of the struggle coupled with Deputy Nixon’s welfare conditions, I decided to relieve 
Deputy Nixon so he could care for himself.
Once Deputy Nixon released his grasp, I then grabbed a hold of 
 left arm, and I could feel the 
tensing of his muscles through his arm and upper body as he was rolling toward me while trying to pull 
and tuck his arm further underneath his body. To prevent 
 from tucking his arm further 
underneath his body, I conducted a modify elongated control hold technique on 
 left arm 
which appeared to be effective. After a struggle of about 6 minutes to control 
 arms, and with 
the assistance of deputies, 
 was secured in handcuff restraint. 
 was first secured with 
two set of handcuff restraint, but for better control, he was then secured with one set of handcuff 
restraint.
Once 
 was secured in restraints, he clearly warned us that he would continue to fight if we 
attempted to escort him in a wheelchair. Based on 
 statement and his assaultive abilities, I 
decided it was safer for us to carry him out of the Pod and place him in a gurney. When carrying 
 I was holding his legs/ankle area. While carrying him, he continued to kick his legs violently, 
thrash his body aggressively, tense his arms, and aggressively move his head around. Based on my 
training and experience, 
 continuous assaultive behaviors were his way of trying to assault or 
to injure us.
 was then carried to the back hallway where he was seen and evaluated by a WellPath 
personnel. I was carrying 
 legs while using the leg restraint chain as leverage which provided 
better control. While carrying and due to 
 continuous aggressive movement, my body worn 
camera was deactivated, but I later activated it again. While in the hallway, 
 continued to be 
assaultive by trying to headbutt and kick me and other deputies.
To prevent 
 powerful kicks from injuring me or my partners, I decided to push the leg restraint 
chain to the ground and pinned it against the floor, but it was ineffective. It was difficult to control 
 legs because every time he aggressively thrashed his body around, he would also use the 
same momentum to propel his lower body to twist and to kick out his legs. When 
 kicked his 
legs out, the leg restraint chain posed a danger to us especially if a hand or a foot become entangle 
against the leg restraint chain. In order to prevent further injuries to deputies and to limited 
 
kicking ability, I decided to push down and step on 
 ankle and pinned it down against the floor 
which appeared to be effective at the time. During the struggle, 
 demanded to ""Get off my foot 
or I am going to kick you again."" With 
 continuing assaultive and resistive behaviors, coupled 
with his statement, proved his intention to assault us. While trying to control 
 in the back 
hallway, my body worn camera dislodged and fell off to the ground.

Later, 
 was then placed/secured onto a gurney where he was escorted to the Outpatient 
Housing Unit (OPHU) for further medical evaluation. While escorting 
 he quickly sat up and 
aggressively scooted forward toward the end of the gurney as he was trying to get off. Based on 
 behavior coupled with him being in restraints, I knew if he falls or if the gurney overturn that 
his safety was at risk. Due to the circumstances and for his safety, I attempted to grab a hold of his left 
arm and the back of his clothing and attempted to pull him backward which appeared to slow him 
down. As I tried to maintain my grasp, 
 lunged towards me and attempted to headbutt me, but I 
moved away, and he missed. He also kicked his legs forward and against the exit slider door frame in 
his effort to prevent him from exiting, but with deputies' assistance, his attempt was unsuccessful.
While escorting and trying to maintain my grasp on 
 clothing, 
 aggressively attempted 
to sit upward. While doing so and as I was trying to maintain my grasp, I realized that the collar of the 
clothing was tightening up against 
 neck which could cause a potential harm to his neck area. 
For 
 safety, and while maintaining my grasp on his clothing, I quickly grab a hold of his chin 
and pushed it down toward the gurney which appeared to be effective. However, our effort appeared 
to upset and agitate 
 which caused him to angrily yell out ""Get off of my neck.""
Once in OPHU, 
 attempted multiple times to grab my hand, but I managed to pull my hand 
away. He also lunged at me and attempted to headbutt me again, but he was unsuccessful. To stop 
him from assaulting me, I attempted to control his head again by pushing the side of his face down 
against the gurney, which appeared to be effective.
After 
 being medically evaluated, he was then assigned and placed inside of OPHU cell #11. 
Inside the cell, 
 managed to roll part of his lower body off the gurney while his arms appeared 
to be stuck to the side of the gurney. During the struggle to remove 
 off the gurney, I attempted 
to control his head by holding the side of his head. With the assistance of deputies, 
 was freed 
from the side of the gurney, and he was secured in a leg and waist restraint. I then conducted a pat 
search of 
 body to make sure he had no other visible injuries or for any unremoved TASER 
dart. One TASER dart was recovered from his back clothing area.
When deputies and I attempted to exit the cell, 
 followed us by aggressively scooting his way 
toward the door. 
 scooted so quickly that his legs were outside the door before deputies could 
secure the door. At one point, I attempted to grab and push his legs inside, but he attempted to kick 
me, so I released my grasp. After multiple attempts by deputies to place 
 inside the cell, the 
door was successfully closed.
Later, Sergeant Ahern took digital photographs of all involved deputies, including photographs of 
 for documentation purposes, and later uploaded them onto a secured server.
I did not sustain any injury during this incident.

NARRATIVE
This incident was recorded by my Axon Body Worn Camera (BWC)(Serial 
). This video 
footage was later uploaded to a secure Axon server. This report is written from my recollection and is 
not a direct transcript of my BWC footage.
On Monday July 31, 2023, I was working as a Deputy Sheriff at Santa Rita Jail (SRJ) in Dublin. I was 
assigned to Housing Unit (HU) 22. I was wearing my full Class “D” uniform with Alameda County 
Sheriff’s Office patches that clearly identified me as a Deputy Sheriff. About 1400 hours, I was 
assigned to be a part of a Resistive Inmate Management (RIM) Team in Housing Unit (HU) 1 for 
inmate 
 
 (
 has extensive history of violent crimes both within and outside of custody, including but not 
limited to:
PC 273.5 - felony domestic violence
PC 245(A)(1) – Assault with a deadly weapon
PC 664/PC 187 – Attempted murder of a peace officer (refer to Newark Police Department report # 22-
02615)
PC 243(C)(1) M – Assault on a peace officer resulting in injury
PC 243(b) – Assault on a peace officer
Due to 
 extensive violent history, 
 was recently on an inmate management plan that 
required him to have recreational time in waist restraints and leg irons. 
 had been off his 
management plan for four days prior to this incident.
Upon my arrival to HU 1, I saw the lower tempered glass window of the lower D-pod door was 
shattered. The glass used for SRJ recreational area windows are multi-layer, laminated tempered 
glass. Due to my training and experience, I know that multi-layer, laminated tempered glass is 
exceptionally stronger than regular glass.

 was sitting on a table inside of the D-pod dayroom looking at deputies with a hostile 
expression on his face. Sergeant D. Dagneau #2168 informed me and other deputies that 
 had 
used his foot to kick and shatter the glass. Sergeant Dagneau also informed me Oleoresin Capsicum 
(OC) had been deployed into the pod. Even from outside D-Pod, the OC began to affect my ability to 
breathe.
Sergeant Dagneau assigned me along with the following deputies to the RIM Team: K. Gregoire, R. 
Taylor, N. Espinoza, S. Riley, and E. Kazimierski. I donned a protective helmet and a vest which had 
the word “Sheriff” clearly marked in lettering on the front and back, which clearly identified me as a 
Deputy Sheriff.
In order to safely detain 
 a plan was developed for deputies to enter D-Pod from the C-Pod 
passthrough door. A “Stingball” device would be deployed into D-Pod to attempt to gain 
 
compliance. A sergeant would be equipped with a 40mm less lethal launcher and a Conducted 
Electrical Weapon (Taser) as intermediate force options should 
 become assaultive. Upon the 
deployment of the Stingball, the RIM Team was instructed to enter D-Pod, advance toward 
 
and detain him in waist and ankle restraints. I was assigned to take control of 
 arms.
As soon as I entered C-Pod, the effects of the OC became much more pronounced and it became 
much harder for me to breathe. The RIM Team staged at the C-Pod passthrough door and waited for 
the signal to execute the plan. I was assigned to be the second deputy in the RIM Team to enter D-
Pod.
The RIM Team was given approval to enter D-Pod and execute our plan. I heard the Stingball activate 
and entered D-Pod with the rest of the RIM Team. As soon as I entered D-Pod, the OC’s effects 
became even more pronounced. I was coughing and had to exert more effort to breathe, further 
affecting my ability to speak and physically exert myself.
I observed that 
 had placed himself in an advantageous position by standing between the pod 
benches and the pod wall by the television. Due to 
 demonstrated level of sophistication in 
previous assaults on staff while in custody, I believe 
 deliberately placed himself in this 
position. This area was advantageous for 
 because it is more confined and limits the movement 
of deputies. As we approached

by 
 right shoulder and began attempting to control 
 right arm, which he was 
attempting to tuck underneath his torso. I found it difficult to get into an advantageous position to gain 
control of 
 due to the confined space and physical presence of other deputies attempting to 
detain him.

overcome 
 active resistance, I placed my right knee on

Deputies decided to use a gurney to transport

hallway. Once we were in the back hallway, we lowered 
 to the floor so he could be medically

 kicked his legs again. I reapplied 
downward pressure with my hands to

NARRATIVE
My departmental issued loaner AXON body worn camera, SRJ-Loaner7 (serial# 
) was 
activated during this incident. The captured footage was later annotated and uploaded to evidence.
com.
On Monday, July 31, 2023, about 1400 hours, I was working at Santa Rita Jail, assigned to Housing 
Unit 3, located at 5325 Broder Boulevard in Dublin, CA. I was wearing my agency approved class-D 
uniform, which clearly identified me as a Deputy Sheriff.
I responded to Housing Unit 1, D-Pod, to assist with a resistive inmate 
 
 (
 who 
was refusing to lockdown after his recreation time concluded. When I arrived, I saw multiple deputies 
attempting to de-escalate 
 to voluntarily lockdown; however, he continued to be non-compliant 
by refusing to lockdown. I also saw 
 had shattered the lower glass panel of the D-Pod dayroom 
door. Housing Unit 1 deputies had already deployed oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray in D-Pod prior to 
my arrival. Based on the fact that 
 had already shattered the lower glass panel of the pod door, 
there was a need to immediately gain control of the situation because once the glass panel was 
completely broken, 
 would have free access to the dining room of Housing Unit 1. This would 
cause a major security issue within Santa Rita Jail.
Several deputies, including Sergeants, had attempted to de-escalate the situation for several minutes, 
and all were met with negative results. Additionally, Adult Forensic Behavioral Health (AFBH) 
attempted to de-escalate the situation, and they were met with negative results. Furthermore, a cool-
down period was provided to 
 and still 
 refused to follow any verbal orders.
De-escalation was attempted by deputies, Sergeants, and AFBH, but 
 refused to comply 
voluntarily. Based on the security of the facility and the need to prevent 
 from injuring himself, 
and the fact that 
 had already shown violent tendencies, it was determined that a resistive 
Inmate Management (RIM) team was needed to gain control of the situation.
Per Sergeant D. Dagneau and Watch Commander Sergeant M. Bitle, a Resistive Inmate Management 
(RIM) team was formed consisting of Deputies K. Gregoire #2251, R. Taylor #2650, A. Huang #2482, 
N. Espinoza #2723, S. Riley #2730 and myself.
Sergeant Dagneau conducted a briefing prior to the RIM team, and I was assigned as the Safety 
Officer. The role of the Safety Officer is to observe the incident and ensure

position which could restrict his breathing. Additionally, I was also tasked with removing any 
equipment in the immediate area from being used by 
 to assault deputies.
While deputies continued to negotiate with 
 to gain his compliance, the RIM team was staged 
in lower C-Pod as an alternative if 
 continued to refuse to lockdown.
We were instructed to make entry through the lower C to D pod passthrough door. A “sting ball” less 
lethal was deployed and we entered lower D-Pod, with me positioned at the back of the team. Upon 
entry, the RIM team advanced towards 
 who strategically positioned himself in the southwest 
corner of D-Pod, near the benches and the TV. 
 refused deputies orders to get onto the 
ground. 
 immediately became assaultive by kicking, punching, headbutting, and biting 
deputies. Additional deputies arrived to assist the RIM team in subduing a still assaultive 
 
 continued to refuse to give up his hands to be subdued and as a result, two taser deployments 
were utilized (refer to Sergeant M. Ahern’s supplemental report).
I removed the shield from the immediate area to prevent 
 from using it as a weapon against 
deputies.
Deputies were eventually able to subdue 
 and place him in handcuffs and ankle restraints after 
approximately 10 minutes.
Once 
 was in restraints, deputies attempted to place him in a wheelchair to be escorted to the 
Outpatient Housing Unit (OPHU). 
 refused to be carried into the wheelchair, saying “as soon as 
y’all pick me up, I’m kicking one of y’all in the face.”
As deputies attempted to lift 
 he kicked both feet out at deputies. Deputies placed him onto the 
floor so they could tactically reposition themselves.
Deputies again lifted 
 and carried him to the back hallway of HU 1. 
 was placed onto the 
floor where he began to violently thrash his body. He remained on the floor until Wellpath arrived to 
medically evaluate him. 
 refused medical treatment from Wellpath.
While waiting for the gurney to arrive, 
 again began to violently thrash his body around. 
 
continued making threats saying he was going to kick deputies.
Deputies lifted and secured 
 to a gurney and began to escort him to OPHU. While escorting 
 out of the East side of HU 1, 
 tried preventing deputies from escorting him out of the 
HU by planting his feet on the frame of the east sliding door.
 continued violently thrashing his body while being escorted to OPHU while yelling and grunting.

 Deputies then placed 
 on the ground on his stomach, where the waist and ankle 
restraints were double locked.
As deputies were exiting cell 11, 
 scooted on his buttocks to the threshold of the door and 
prevented deputies from securing the door by sticking his feet through the threshold of the door and 
pushing his body weight against the door. Deputies attempted to push his feet back in; however, 
 violently kicked his legs out at deputies attempting to further assault them.

NARRATIVE

My department issued Axon camera was activated during the following call for service.
The footage was uploaded to the secure server and annotated.

has generated a violent history during his time at Santa Rita Jail, particularly one
assault on staff | witnessed prior to this incident (23-006020). During this incident, I
demonstrated his ability to assault and batter staff unrestrained and after being restrained. It is without
doubt is a sophisticated threat at Santa Rita Jail. It appears Santa Rita Jail has become unfit
or unsafe for due to the following reports that have been written in relation to

PC 240-Assault (1 report)

PC 243(b)-Battery on a peace officer (4 reports)

PC 242-battery (5 reports)

PC 148(a)(1)-Obstruct/delay/resist a peace officer (4 reports)

PC 594-Vandalism (3 reports)

On Monday, July 1, 2023, about 1500 hours, | responded to Housing Unit 1 to assist in a RIM Team
involving il] EE was out for recreation time during a trial period not implementing his
Management Plan. Prior to this trial period, [MJ had to adhere to a strict Management Plan which
included the wearing of restraints during recreation time. At this time, those restraints had not been
placed on him due to his recent behavior. Subsequently, J became uncontrollable, hostile,
threatening, and a danger to Santa Rita Jail facility, staff, and other incarcerated persons. During

recreation time, JM kicked the D Pod door and shattered the glass.

Once | arrived at the Housing Unit, | was tasked to equip the less lethal munitions.

Less Lethal Weapons Systems: Those munitions that can be fired, launched, or otherwise propelled 
for the purpose of engaging compliance, overcoming resistance, or preventing serious injury without 
posing a significant potential for causing death.
The circumstances justifying the use of less lethal weapons systems include, but are not limited to: 
1.Restoration or maintenance of order during jail or civil disturbances
2.Safely controlling non-compliant/violent persons.
3.Situations where the first line supervisor or Commanding Officer deem necessary to safely resolve 
the incident with a lesser potential of serious injury to citizens and deputies.
As a less lethal weapons operator, I carried the following:
Sting Ball Grenade, which is a is a device that delivers rubber pellets, a bright flash and sound. The 
Sting Ball Grenade is commonly used as a crowd management tool. The Sting Ball Grenade has an 
initial 1.5 second delay that initiates fuze assembly separation, followed by another .5 second delay 
before the blast which is sufficient to project the rubber balls in an approximate 50 foot radius.
A LMT 40mm Less Lethal launcher. The LMT 40mm Less Lethal Launcher is a single shot launcher 
that fires standard 40mm less lethal ammunition. This ammunition varies from impact munitions, which 
utilize pain compliance by imparting kinetic energy into a subject, as well as chemical agents, and 
marking rounds.
After I was equipped with the proper munitions for the RIM team, I entered C Pod and waited for the 
authorization for entry and deployment. Once the RIM team was assembled, they met with me at the 
upper C Pod passthrough door.
Attempts to deescalate with 
 went on for quite some time but subsequently failed. After enough 
reasonable time had passed for de-escalation, authorization was given for entry into D pod.
In accordance with department General Orders 1.05, 21.01.01, and 1.21, along with the RIM team, I 
obtained authorization from Lieutenant J. Atienza to enter D Pod and deploy a Sting Ball Grenade to 
distract 
 and gain control of the situation safely. I placed the Sting Ball Grenade at the D pod 
door where 
 focused his attention. The Sting Ball Grenade was an effective deployment and 
appeared to distract and guide 
 away from the damaged pod door. We executed a dynamic 
entry to gain access to D pod. Our primary concern was to deescalate 
 violent behavior and 
detain him without further incident. I moved downstairs to the first level of the pod and accessed the 
LMT 40mm Less Lethal Launcher. I gave 
 several lawful orders to get on the ground but he 
refused.
 put himself between the D/E pod wall and the D pod benches. 
 is a sophisticated fighter 
and I believed he put himself in this position to help create a position of advantage for himself and 
disadvantage for us. 
 knows it is easier to fight deputies in confined spaces rather than open 
spaces.

I gave 
 ample time to obey lawful commands and did not utilize the LMT 40mm Less Lethal 
Launcher in hopes I could use that time to deescalate his violent behavior and gain compliance, but I 
was unsuccessful.
The RIM team moved passed me and engaged with

 was also 
assaultive during this time. At one point, I saw 
 had disarmed a deputy and had complete 
control of an ACSO baton. Additionally, Deputy Gregoire, who was on scene, was bit by 
 during 
the altercation. Deputy Gregoire vocalized the bite numerous times to alert his partners.
For about two minutes, deputies had been struggling to gain control of

is a patient and intelligent fighter. Once he has the opportunity, he will quickly use any window of 
opportunity to assault staff. If 
 has an unrestrained limb, he will use it to assault staff. At this 
point, I wanted to ensure we reduced any further risk of injury to deputies and 
 I wanted 
 to be incapacitated so he had absolutely no opportunity to assault staff, bite staff, or gain 
control of our less lethal weapons. With the amount of deputies that were attempting to overcome 
 resistance, I was concerned about potential injuries 
 could have sustained during the 
incident which included unnecessary back/neck injury and positional asphyxiation.
Based on the totality of circumstances which included 
 sophistication and his ability to assault 
staff on the ground, unrestrained and even restrained, I believed deploying the taser was our best 
option to overcome his resistance and prevent any further significant injury to him and deputies. I 
believed neuromuscular incapacitation which is defined as causing loss of sufficient voluntary muscle 
control, which prevents the subject from advancing and achieving their goal.
I approached 
 and observed the following.
I noticed a deputy had vomited on

affected by the OC that had been deployed in the pod, prior to our arrival. We were all uncontrollably 
coughing and it appeared it had little to no effect on

based on how we reacted to the OC deployment. This was a concern to me because I have personally 
witnessed 
 capitalize on attacks towards deputies when he is given the slightest opportunity. I 
believed 
 would use this advantage if he had the ability to do so.
I advised 
 I would deploy my TASER if he did not stop resisting. 
 ignored my notification 
and continued to resist deputies. I had little room and not enough stand off to deploy one set of darts. 
Additionally, I did not want to drive stun 
 and potentially create multiple points of contact that 
could be unreasonable. I believed it was the safest option to detain 
 was to target the large 
muscle groups on 
 and to deploy my TASER on his buttocks/upper thigh and upper back. The 
deployment was effective, but the deployment prevented him from being able to roll over and free his 
arms. After the TASER was deployed, deputies were able to gain control of 
 arms and placed 
them behind his back. Once they were behind his back, 
 continued to resist and pull away from 
the deputies. Deputy Cotton attempted to gain control of 
 left arm. While Deputy Cotton 
struggled to overcome 
 active resistance, he hit my hand and I activated my taser for about 
two seconds. The activation was not intentional or planned. I later notified Sergeant D. Dagneau and 
Lieutenant J. Atienza.

SUMMARY:

   
   
     

On February 21, 2024, at approximately 10:04 p.m., the Calexico Police Department (CPD) requested the Imperial
County District Attorney (ICDA) Bureau of Investigation (BOI) investigate an Officer Involved shooting (OIS
that involved one of their officers who discharged their weapon at a subject. The OIS occurred at a
Calexico, CA, 92231 and involved officers from CPD.

This report documents the initial notification and request for assistance by CPD to ICDA-BOI Commander
(Cmdr.) O. Espino. Below is a summary of the investigative actions taken by Cmdr O. Espino.

DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION:
Notification:

On February 21, 2024, at about 10:04 p.m., I, Cmdr. Orlando Espino, received a telephone call from CPD Chief
of Police (COP) A. Orozco advising CPD was involved in an officer involved shooting and that the Imperial
County District Attorney’s Office was being requested to conduct the investigation.

| reached out to ICDA-BOI Chief Investigator Justin Matus, who instructed CPD to contact the California
Department of Justice (CAL DOJ) in accordance with AB 1506. I subsequently relayed this information to COP
Orozco and directed him to contact CAL DOJ, providing him with the necessary contact details.

After a brief period, COP Orozco informed me that Special Agent Sean Richardson from CAL DOJ had advised
him to refer the incident to ICDA. Following this, I contacted Chief Matus, Cmdr. Armstrong, and DAI's Victor
Dominguez, Marco Lopez, Albert Llanas, and Rafael Peraza.

Arrival:

At approximately 11:00 p.m., | reached the general vicinity of the Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS) and was met
away from the OIS scene by COP Orozco and Sergeant (Sgt.) M. Carbajal. From my vantage point, | observed
CPD had secured the area with yellow tape and had assigned a CPD Ofc. to monitor the scene with a log. I then
inquired about the status of the public safety statement and COP Orozco confirmed that it had been furnished to
Sgt. Carbajal. He then proceeded to brief the following:

Ofc. Hernandez and Sgt. Carbajal were dispatched TTD -<carding a reported burglary. Upon arrival,
they observed a familiar male, identified as CHRISTIAN Plancarte, whom they had encountered on multiple
occasions at that location. According to COP Orozco, CHRISTIAN approached Sgt. Carbajal wielding a crowbar

in an apparent attempt to strike him. Officer Hernandez then discharged his weapon three times, hitting
CHRISTIAN once in the torso, grazing his leg, and striking a vehicle in the driveway.

Following the incident, CHRISTIAN received first aid from Sgt. Carbajal, Ofc. Hernandez, and Ofc. Torres
before being taken to a hospital by the Calexico Fire Department. I subsequently departed from the scene and
awaited the arrival of the responding ICDA DAI’s.

Prior to my arrival, CPD requested the Imperial County Sheriff's Office (ICSO) Scientific Investigations Unit
(SIU) assistance in processing both the officers and scene.

Investigator note: On February 26, 2024, at approximately 11:45 a.m., I called COP Orozco and asked if (on the
date of the OIS) he instructed Ofc. Hernandez and Sgt Carbajal to not discuss the incident with anyone except
union representatives or DAI’s. COP Orozco replied he had not.

Briefing:

At approximately 12:00 a.m., COP Orozco and Sgt Carbajal met with the following DAI’s and provided a in
depth briefing: Chief Investigator Matus, Cmdr Armstrong, Dominguez, Lopez, Llanas, Peraza, and me. They
related the following:

 

Officer A. Hernandez and Sgt. M. Carbajal were dispatched t egarding a burglary in progress.
Upon their arrival, they identified a male individual, CHRISTIAN Plancarte, whom they had encountered multiple
times at that address. Considering CHRISTIAN's history of law enforcement interactions and previous arrests,
CPD was aware of his mental health issues and tendency to display aggression during such encounters. CPD was
also aware the reporting was his elderly mother who they believed was hiding in one of the rooms inside the
house. CPD also mentioned there had been restraining orders prohibiting CHRISTIAN from the residence but
were not sure if they had expired or were active. As they approached the scene, they heard loud banging noises
emanating from the residence, and observed CHRISTIAN violently attempting to enter the residence through the
front door. Subsequently, CHRISTIAN charged towards Sgt Carbajal raising the crowbar as if it were a baseball
bat, aiming to strike him. Officer A. Hernandez responded by discharging his weapon three times; hitting
CHRISTIAN once in the torso, grazing his leg, striking a nearby vehicle, and ultimately causing CHRISTIAN to
collapse in the driveway. Shortly after, Ofe A. Torres arrived on scene.

Following the incident, Sgt. Carbajal, Ofc. Hernandez, and Ofc. Torres administered first aid to CHRISTIAN
before he was transported to a hospital. They also indicated CPD Ofc’s had interviewed a witness and had
canvassed the area.

Finally, it was mentioned that Ofc. C. Fraker, PY and a third individual identified as a.

mother, were currently inside the residence with the reporting party. and her mother had a familial
relationship with CHRISTIAN as [iiwas dating CHRISTIAN’ brother.

Summary of Deputy Maldonado's Statement:

Deputy Maldonado believed the allegation was related to an incident that occurred approximately
one month ago when he engaged in sexual activity while on duty. He disclosed that, at the time of
the incident, he was dealing with personal difficulties related to his girlfriend's infidelity, which
greatly impacted his judgment.

Deputy Maldonado recounted the contact with i EJ stating the initial encounter
occurred in the Safeway parking lot located in the City of American Canyon. Deputy Maldonado
stated he was dispatched to a call for service in the area of Safeway in the City of American
Canyon to look for a missing person. During that call for service, he was contacted by a female
subject who had followed him to the south end of the parking lot. The female started making
remarks that she thought Deputy Maldonado was ""cute"", asked if he would handcuff her, and
wanted to know what time he was going to be off shift. The female continued to be very
persistent, making sexual remarks to Deputy Maldonado. Deputy Maldonado stated this made
him feel uncomfortable that she was saying these things to him in public, so he tried to cut the
conversation short. Deputy Maldonado said he found {J attractive, so he asked for
phone number and told her he would contact her later. Deputy Maldonado finished his call for
service and later went back to the office. He then started texting with J throughout the
evening and expressed a desire to see her. The situation escalated when Deputy Maldonado and
GB met later, at approximately 0200 hours, in an undeveloped subdivision east of Newell
Drive, known as Canyon Estates. The area has paved roads but currently no homes are built on

the property.

Deputy Maldonado stated initially he and {iM sat in SY vehicle and simply had a
conversation. After some time, Deputy Maldonado was dispatched for another call for service but
was subsequently canceled. Deputy Maldonado decided to stay, and at this time he and aa
kissed outside her car. Deputy Maldonado stated this is when things began to escalate quite a bit.
Deputy Maldonado entered {J vehicle front passenger seat and [MM sat in the driver's

seat. MM then started to push harder for a sexual interaction. Deputy Maldonado stated he
initially kept refusing telling {J he didn't want to lose his job. Deputy Maldonado told
that he could not have sexual contact on duty. {J kept leaning over from the driver's seat
and kissing Deputy Maldonado's cheek and neck and touching his thigh. Deputy Maldonado stated
he let things progress from there and allowed a to touch his genitalia and he started to kiss
her back. Deputy Maldonado continued to tell J he could not have sexual contact while he
was on duty. Deputy Maldonado stated that {ij then crawled over into the passenger seat
and unzipped Deputy Maldonado's pants. J then performed oral sex for a short time then
turned around and they had sex for about “four of five minutes”. Deputy Maldonado said he then
""came to his senses” and stated he couldn't engage in this type of conduct while he was on duty.
Deputy Maldonado admitted he engaged in consensual sexual activity with ay

Deputy Maldonado did meet {J at her residence in J later once he was off duty.
Deputy Maldonado stated that aay insistence on a relationship and her changing statements
about her marital status and relationship status and children contributed to his decision to end
communication with her. He also learned later that {J had surreptitiously recorded their
sexual encounter at her residence in Ec without his knowledge. She later tried to use this as
leverage to keep Deputy Maldonado engaged ina relationship. {J also sent Deputy
Maldonado fuzzy pictures of what looked like pregnancy tests alleging he had impregnated her.
GEE also tracked down Deputy Maldonado’s recent girlfriend and threatened to share details
of their encounter if he didn’t do what she wanted.

Deputy Maldonado identified [I EE by 2 CalPhoto that was shown to him during the
interview. Deputy Maldonado stated he only knew {i by her first name,

Deputy Maldonado confirmed that all the sexual contact occurred in SM vehicle, and no
departmental equipment or vehicle was involved.

Deputy Maldonado expressed regret for his actions, acknowledged the potential policy violation,
and confirmed he had ceased all communication with aa after being informed of the
complaint.

did not know {ij before the initial encounter. Deputy Maldonado also stated he did not
know anything about {MJ criminal history in the County of Napa.

SUMMARY

The incident involving Deputy Maldonado occurred on December 1, 2023, at approximately 0200
hours, when Deputy Maldonado engaged in a consensual sexual encounter while on duty. The
encounter originated from a chance meeting at Safeway parking lot in the City of American
Canyon, escalating when Deputy Maldonado and the complainant, a later
convened in an undeveloped subdivision. Despite Deputy Maldonado's initial refusals of physical
interaction due to on-duty constraints, J persisted, leading to consensual sexual activity in
her vehicle. Deputy Maldonado, expressing remorse, acknowledged the potential policy violation
and ended all communication with a after the internal affairs complaint was initiated. The
detailed account, obtained during the interview conducted on January 16, 2024, offers insight into
Deputy Maldonado's actions, motivations, and the context surrounding the alleged misconduct.

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

RE: Napa Sheriff's Department Policy 324.3.4 (aa) ~ Performance (Sustained)

1. Complainant's Targeting of Deputy Maldonado: Based on the investigation, it appears
that {J may have intentionally targeted Deputy Maldonado, initiating contact at
Safeway and persisting in her pursuit of him. Gee behavior, making explicit remarks
in public and meeting Deputy Maldonado in an isolated location, raises concerns about
her motives and intentions during the encounter.

2. Threats and Retaliation: J behavior took a troubling turn when Deputy
Maldonado declined to engage in an ongoing relationship. Her persistent attempts to
coerce Deputy Maldonado into continuing the relationship, coupled with threats and
agitation when he declined, suggest potential manipulation and retaliation. This aspect of
the incident raises questions about aa intentions and underscores the need to
consider her actions in the broader context of the encounter.

3. Impact on Deputy Maldonado: Deputy Maldonado’s personal struggles, including learning
about his girlfriend's recent infidelity, may have influenced his judgment during the
encounter. However, the complainant's targeted actions and threats, as described, further
complicate the dynamics of the situation. Understanding the impact of these external
factors on Deputy Maldonado's decision-making is crucial in assessing the incident
comprehensively.

4. Complainant's Uncooperativeness: BM almost immediate uncooperativeness after
reporting the incident raises suspicions of a purposeful effort to inflict distress and
simultaneously hinder the investigation. This aspect adds a layer of complexity to the case,

IA Report Maldonado.doc
2/16/2024

requiring careful consideration of [MJ motivations for reporting the conduct and
subsequently withdrawing cooperation.

5. Policy Violation and Accountability: Deputy Maldonado's admission of engaging in
consensual sexual activity while on duty represents a clear violation of departmental
policy. The circumstances surrounding the encounter, including Deputy Maldonado’s
recognition of the policy violation and his subsequent remorse, are important
considerations in determining the appropriate level of accountability and potential
disciplinary actions.

6. PC 832.7 (B): The provisions outlined in 832.7 (B) of the relevant statute establish clear
guidelines regarding the conduct of peace officers concerning sexual acts involving
members of the public.

Subsection (ii) of the statute states, “As used in this subparagraph, ""sexual assault"" means
the commission or attempted initiation of a sexual act with a member of the public by
means of force, threat, coercion, extortion, offer of leniency or other official favor, or
under the color of authority. For purposes of this definition, the propositioning for or
commission of any sexual act while on duty is considered a sexual assault.”

The investigation conducted into Deputy Maldonado’s conduct on duty did not reveal any
evidence of force, threat, coercion, extortion, offer of leniency, or other official favor.
However, Deputy Maldonado’'s conduct did violate the prohibition against engaging in
sexual acts while on duty.

FINDING

RE: Napa Sheriff’s Department Policy 324.3.4 (aa) - Performance

1. Any on-duty or off-duty conduct that an employee knows or reasonably should know is
unbecoming a member of the Department or is contrary to the good order, efficiency, or
morale, or reflects unfavorably upon the Department or its members.

Based on my investigation, with scrutiny concerning {J motivations and her sudden
uncooperativeness, | find that Deputy Maldonado did engage in a consensual sexual encounter
while in uniform and on duty. | also find that Deputy Maldonado was aware that his actions were a
clear violation of department policy that could result in discipline at the least, and his conduct was
unbecoming of himself and the Napa County Sheriff's Department. Deputy Maldonado put the
department and himself in an unnecessary vulnerable position that was completely avoidable. The
dynamics of the encounter should shape the findings, and inform the appropriate course of
action, balancing accountability with an understanding of the incident's nature.

Therefore, my finding regarding the violation of this section is sustained.

1A Report Maldonado.doc
2/16/2024

FINDING

With respect to the allegation that Deputy Maldonado’s conduct constituted a

violation of 324.3.4 (aa) - Performance. The finding is:

_____ Unfounded: Sufficient evidence proves the allegation(s) did not occur.
X_ Sustained: Sufficient evidence proves the allegations(s) occurred.

Not Sustained: There is no evidence to prove or disprove the allegation(s)

Exonerated: The allegation(s) did occur, however the act(s) were justified,
lawful, and proper.

INVESTIGATION: 
 
Notification:  
On Sunday, October 1, 2023, at 0930 hours, I received a telephone call at my residence from 
Lieutenant Conaty.  Lieutenant Conaty informed me there had been an officer involved shooting 
in the city of Antioch, which involved four actor officers, and several witnessing officers.  
Lieutenant Conaty advised the suspect had been transported to the hospital and was in critical 
condition.   
 
At approximately 1000 hours, I arrived at the Antioch Police Department.  Upon arrival, I met 
with additional Inspectors from the District Attorney's Office, and Detectives from the Antioch 
Police Department.     
 
At approximately 1200 hours, I attended a briefing conducted by Antioch Police Detective 
Sergeant Colley regarding the shooting and what led up to it.  During the briefing, I learned the 
following information:   
 
On Thursday, September 26, 2023, at approximately 1418 hours, Community Service 
Officer Graham responded to the Cube Smart Self Storage located at 1790 Vineyard 
Drive in the city of Antioch.  CSO Graham was responding to the onsite manager,

, who was reporting a vehicle theft from the location.  At this time, CSO Graham 
reviewed surveillance footage of the vehicle theft, which occurred earlier the same day.  
While reviewing the surveillance footage, CSO Graham saw that on Thursday, September 
26, 2023, at approximately 0130 hours, two unknown male subjects were walking 
around inside the storage yard.  At approximately 0152 hours, a blue or purple panel van 
is seen entering the storage yard via the rear gate, located at the end of Vineyard Drive.  
The panel van then can be seen pushing a white 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Cal. 
License Plate #
) out of the south gate of the storage yard onto E. 18th Street.  
Once the panel van and the Monte Carlo exited the south gate, CSO Graham was unable 
to see them because it was out of the surveillance camera's view.   
 
advised that nobody had permission to be at the storage yard, at that 
time.   
then provided CSO Graham with the owner of the Monte Carlo 
personal information.  CSO Graham made telephone contact with the owner of the 
Monte Carlo, (
 who currently resides in Florida, and he advised that he 
did not give anyone permission to have his vehicle.  CSO Graham completed a stolen 
vehicle report, and requested the surveillance footage of the incident from Cube Smart 
Self Storage, as evidence of the theft.  CSO Graham later entered the stolen Monte Carlo 
into the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS) and returned to his duties.   
 
On Sunday, October 1, 2023, at approximately 0741 hours, CSO Graham was conducting 
his patrol duties, when he noticed a white Chevrolet Monte Carlo backed into the 
carport of 
  The Monte Carlo was covered with a tarp.  CSO 
Graham noticed a blue panel van backed into the carport next to the Monte Carlo.  CSO 
Graham believed the blue panel van was similar to the one he saw involved with the 
theft of the Monte Carlo on Thursday, September 26, 2023.  Based on this, CSO Graham 
contacted dispatch, and requested assistance from patrol.  K-9 Officer Marques 
responded to assist CSO Graham, as did Officer Dibble, Officer Mulholland, and his 
Trainee Officer Posey.   
 
Officer Marques arrived on the scene followed by Officer Dibble.  The officers 
approached the suspected stolen Monte Carlo, pulled back the tarp, and discovered it

was unoccupied.  Officer Marques confirmed the Monte Carlo was the stolen vehicle 
CSO Graham had been investigating on Thursday, September 26, 2023.  Officer Marques 
then conducted a record check of the blue panel van which had a license plate of 
.  This vehicle returned with an expired registration in 2018.  Officer Marques 
began looking into the interior of the blue panel van through the side cargo door 
windows on the passenger side.  As Officer Marques did this, he noticed someone (later 
identified as suspect Daniel Mackin) was sleeping in the rear cargo area of the vehicle 
with a handgun lying next to him in plain view.   
 
Officer Marques advised dispatch of this observation, and the officers quickly backed 
away from the suspect vehicle and took cover near their patrol vehicles.  At this point, 
Officer Mulholland and his trainee, Officer Posey arrived on the scene.  Hearing this 
information over the radio, Officer Borg, and his trainee, Officer Armstrong responded as 
well.  Officers noticed that Mackin was now awake, and looking out the front windshield 
at the Antioch Police Officers surrounding the van.  Officers began giving Mackin orders 
to step out of the van with his hands up, however, he did not comply.  Officers Borg and 
Officer Armstrong arrived on the scene and took a position near Officer Marques' patrol 
vehicle.  
 
At this time, Mackin got into the driver's seat of the van and started it.  Mackin then 
attempted to flee, by driving the van through the apartment building's parking lot over a 
curb/green belt area, and onto A Street.  The van then hit a utility box, and a street sign 
pole, at which time it became stuck.  Officers continued to give Mackin orders to come 
out of the van, but Mackin refused.  Mackin began to back up and drive forward several 
times, in an attempt to free the van and escape.  At this time, Officer Mulholland utilized 
a 40mm less lethal weapon to break out the driver's side window of the van.  After four 
unsuccessful attempts to break the van's driver's side window, Mackin fled on foot out 
the side cargo doors of the van.   
 
As Mackin fled from the van he was holding something in his waistband or hooded 
sweatshirt front pocket with his left hand.  As Mackin fled eastbound on A Street, Officer 
Marques deployed his police K-9 to apprehend him.  As Mackin fled he was followed by

a small dog that had been inside the van.  The small dog distracted the police K-9, which 
prevented the K-9 from apprehending Mackin.  As Mackin ran, the officers could now 
see a chrome handgun in his right hand.   
 
As Mackin continued to run east, he turned several times toward the police officers 
pursuing him, and was now pointing the handgun in their direction.  The pursuing 
officers, then fired several times at Mackin as he fled.  At one point Mackin fell to the 
ground and came to rest in a seated position on the north curbline, still pointing the 
handgun at the officers.  Officers then fired additional shots at Mackin as he got to his 
feet, still pointing the handgun in the direction of pursuing officers.  Mackin continued to 
run eastbound on A Street, with the handgun in his right hand.  As Mackin ran, he threw 
the handgun, over his head in a northern direction.  The handgun landed on the north 
sidewalk of A Street, where it was later recovered fully, loaded with six live rounds.   
 
Once the handgun was discarded, officers verbally announced Mackin had discarded it, 
and no other shots were fired.  Mackin ran approximately another 10-15 yards until he 
came to a stop, went to his knees, and laid down on the ground in the middle of A 
street.  Officers approached Mackin who had sustained one through and through 
gunshot wound to his torso.  Mackin was immediately handcuffed, and emergency 
medical personnel were requested.  Officers obtained a medical kit from a patrol vehicle, 
and began administering first aid.  Fire and ambulance personnel arrived and Mackin 
was transported to John Muir Hospital, Walnut Creek Campus.  Per medical staff at John 
Muir Hospital, Mackin had sustained injuries to both lungs as a result of being shot.  
Mackin was intubated and was being treated for his injuries.   
 
After Sergeant Colley's briefing, we reviewed the body-worn camera footage of the involved 
officers.  Sergeant Colley advised that Mackin was currently listed in critical condition, but was 
expected to survive.

Crime Scene Description:  
 
At approximately 1300 hours, Detective Duffy and I responded to 
to assess 
the crime scene.  The scene was cordoned off by crime scene tape, and Antioch Police 
personnel were providing scene security and maintaining a crime scene log.  The Contra Costa 
Crime Lab, Contra Costa District Attorney's Office, and Antioch PD Crime Scene Investigators 
were also on the scene conducting their duties.  I could see the blue van Mackin attempted to 
flee in, had struck a utility box and a street sign pole from driving over the curbed parking lot 
and into the vegetation between the parking lot and A Street.  In an easterly direction on A 
Street, I could see several crime scene plaques marking numerous expended shell casings.   
Further east on the north sidewalk of A Street, I saw another crime scene plaque that marked a 
chrome revolver.  A short distance further east was clothing and blood in the middle of the 
street.

storage units and a carport.  The second and third floors consist of four, two bedroom

apartments on each floor.  The apartments all face north with a common parking lot that is 
accessible from a W. 3rd Street entry/exit point.  
 
After assessing the crime scene, Detective Duffy and I responded back to the Antioch Police 
Department.  Upon our arrival, we were advised that the actor officers were not going to 
provide statements that day, and those interviews were scheduled for Tuesday, October 3, 2023, 
at 1000 hours, at the Antioch Police Department.   
 
In preparation for the interviews of the officers, Detective Duffy and I conducted a further 
review of the body-worn camera footage of the incident.  This was done in an attempt to 
determine when the last shot was fired, relative to when Mackin discarded the handgun.  At 
08:05:51 hours the last shot was fired and at 08:05:54 hours, Mackin discards the handgun.  
This was confirmed by the Antioch Police Department's shot spotter system and the officers' 
body-worn cameras.   
 
On Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1011 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Armstrong 
and his attorney, Michael Rains of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.  We met in the 
second floor conference room of the administrative wing of the Antioch Police Department.  
This interview was digitally recorded with Officer Armstrong's knowledge.  After introducing 
ourselves, I initiated the interview by explaining to Officer Armstrong that the purpose of the 
interview was to determine the facts and circumstances that surround this incident.   
 
I also told Officer Armstrong this was a voluntary statement, and that he could stop at any time 
if he needed to take a break or speak with his attorney.  Officer Armstrong told me he 
understood.  I then asked Officer Armstrong to tell me about his background, including his 
training and experience.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the following:  
 
Officer Kyle Armstrong Training and Experience:  
He attended the basic police academy and was hired by the Antioch Police Department.  
He has been in orientation training for approximately a week, and Sunday, October 1, 
2023, was his first day on patrol.  He spent 10 years in the military, and reached the rank 
of Sergeant in the U.S. Army, in a communications unit.  He deployed once to

Afghanistan and once to Somalia.  He does not have any prior law enforcement 
experience and has a high school diploma and some college; however, he does not have 
a degree.   
 
After Officer Armstrong provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what 
happened that led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the 
following:  
 
Officer Kyle Armstrong Statement:  
Sunday, October 1, 2023, was his first day in the field training program.  He works from 
0630 hours until 1900 hours, which is a red day's schedule.  He had a good night's sleep 
and was well rested and ready for his day.  He was dressed in the Antioch Police 
Uniform, with visible A.P.D. patches on his shoulders and an embroidered badge as well 
as a duty belt with his department issued firearm.  His firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 
department issued handgun, which can carry a standard 17-round magazine plus one 
additional round in the chamber.  He was loaded with 16 rounds in the magazine and 
one in the chamber.  He also had two additional magazines with him.  One had 16 
rounds and the other had 17 rounds.  He was short 2 rounds of duty ammunition, 
because while he was at the range the week before he dropped two rounds on the 
ground and never found them.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, 
which was activated during this incident.    
 
He attended a briefing with his Training Officer, Officer Borg.  After the briefing, they 
collected paperwork he would need in preparation for his day.  As they did this, there 
was a call over the police radio of a subject sleeping in a vehicle with a firearm in his 
hand.  Officer Borg told him they were going to respond to the call, so they headed to 
their fully marked A.P.D. patrol vehicle.  Once at their patrol vehicle, they responded to 
the detail.  As they responded, Officer Borg had him read the details of the call from the 
computer (Mobil Data Terminal, M.D.T.).  The details of this call were that officers had 
located a possible stolen vehicle, and next to the vehicle a subject was sleeping in a van 
with a firearm in his lap.

They drove down 2nd Street to respond to the call, and did not turn on any emergency 
lights or siren to get there.  Upon arrival, they parked their patrol vehicle, and he could 
see Training Officer Mulholland and his trainee, Officer Posey.  He also saw Officer 
Dibble and K9 Officer Marques.  He could see two patrol vehicles facing a blue panel van 
with their overhead emergency lights on.  He also could see officers pointing their 
firearms at the van and giving commands to a subject inside the van (later identified as 
Daniel Mackin).   He and Officer Borg drew their firearms, and took a position to assist.   
 
He could not see anyone in the van at this time; however, he was told Mackin was in the 
back of the van, and he could see some movement inside.  There was a curtain between 
the front compartment of the van and the cargo area in the back, which prevented him 
from clearly seeing into the van.  From this vantage point, he could see the curtains 
dividing the front and the back of the van shift as if someone had crawled underneath 
them to move to the front of the cabin.  Suddenly he could see Mackin in the driver's 
seat, as the van's engine started.     
 
Numerous commands were given to Mackin to get out of the van; however, Mackin did 
not comply.  Mackin put the van in drive, and started to pull out of the parking stall he 
was backed into.  Mackin attempted to drive over the curb bordering the parking lot and 
onto A Street; however, the van became stuck or high-sided in the vegetation between 
the parking lot and A Street.  Mackin also hit a utility box and a street sign pole with the 
front of the van.   
 
At this point, Officer Borg ran back to their patrol vehicle and turned it around.  Officer 
Borg positioned the vehicle facing northbound on 3rd Street in the event Mackin was 
able to drive away and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Officers continued to give Mackin 
verbal commands to surrender.  He noticed that K9 Officer Marques had retrieved his K9 
from his patrol vehicle.  At this point, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles 
in the area behind the van.  Officer Mulholland utilized a 40mm less lethal gun in an 
attempt to break out the driver's side window of the van.  This was not effective as the 
rubber rounds ricocheted off the van.  Officer Mulholland continued to fire several

rounds at the van, but he was uncertain how many.  The rounds just kept ricocheting off 
the van, which he believed was due to the angle Officer Mulholland was firing from.   
 
He could see Mackin moved out of the driver's compartment area and back into the rear 
cargo area of the van.  He could no longer see Mackin, and they were aware he was still 
in possession of the handgun.  Officer Mulholland ran out of ammunition for the 40mm, 
so Mulholland moved to another vehicle to retrieve more.  During this time, Mackin 
continued to try and free the van by backing up and driving forward.  The tires of the van 
were just spinning, and he was unable to free the van.  Officer Borg requested Officer 
Mulholland attempt to shoot out the back window of the van with the 40mm less lethal 
weapon.  As Officer Mulholland was repositioning himself to take a shot with the 40mm, 
the right side cargo door of the van opened and Mackin stepped out of the van.  Officer 
Borg and Officer Mulholland both gave Mackin commands to get down on the ground, 
but he did not comply.   
 
Mackin pulled the hood of his hooded sweatshirt up over his head.  As Mackin did this, 
he had a small dog in the van with him that jumped out as well.  Mackin looked like he 
was holding the handgun in his front sweatshirt pocket with his left hand as he began to 
flee eastbound on A Street.  He could see what appeared to be the handle of the 
handgun sticking out of the sweatshirt pocket.  K9 Officer Marques deployed his K9 and 
began to pursue Mackin.  He and Officer Borg both gave chase as well.  As they pursued 
Mackin, Officer Marques, and Officer Borg were to his left.  He was not sure where 
Officer Mulholland, Officer Dibble, or Officer Posey were exactly; however, he knew they 
were somewhere around him.   
 
As Mackin fled on foot, Mackin fell near a light pole.  When Mackin fell to the ground, 
Mackin took a seated position along the curb line.  He could now see Mackin holding the 
silver or chrome firearm in his right hand and pointing it in the direction of Officer 
Marques and Officer Borg.  He could not tell if the handgun was a revolver or a semi-
automatic.  He could only see the barrel of the handgun.  He feared for the lives of his 
fellow officers, at which time he felt deadly force was necessary.  He then heard a shot 
fired by one of the officers near him, possibly to his left.  He then stopped running, took

aim, and fired approximately 2 rounds at Mackin.  He estimated he was approximately 
20 to 25 feet away from Mackin when he fired his first shots.   
 
At this time, he heard several rounds being fired by his fellow officers to his left.  
However, Mackin did not appear to be hurt or hit, at which time Mackin got back up and 
continued running eastbound on A Street.  As Mackin was fleeing eastbound, Mackin 
continually turned, looking back at the officers pursuing him.  He wasn't sure if Mackin 
was turning to shoot at them while fleeing, so each time Mackin turned towards them 
with the handgun in his hand, he and the other officers would fire at Mackin.  He fired 
approximately 6 more rounds at Mackin and each time he fired, he reassessed the 
situation.    
 
As Mackin fled, Mackin did what he described as a ""Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hook shot"" 
and threw the handgun with his right hand over his head in a northern direction.  Once 
Mackin discarded the handgun, he yelled out to everyone, ""he dropped the gun.""  Once 
he yelled out that Mackin no longer had the handgun in his possession, no other shots 
were fired.  It was unclear if Mackin was merely discarding the handgun or trying to 
throw it into the adjacent river.   The handgun came to rest on the north sidewalk of A 
Street.  Moments later, Mackin collapsed and fell to the ground where he was 
handcuffed and taken into custody.  Once Mackin was safely in custody, they began 
administering first aid.  Mackin had sustained an apparent gunshot wound to his torso 
during the incident.   
 
They immediately requested emergency medical personnel to their location.  He quickly 
ran back to his patrol vehicle and brought it to the location to get medical supplies out of 
the rear.  CSO Graham had also brought his car up.  At that point, he began blocking off 
the crime scene and preventing traffic from coming through.   
 
He is uncertain if Mackin fired his gun.  He believes he fired approximately 8 rounds at 
Mackin during this incident.  There were several minutes between the time Mackin was 
first confronted and ordered out of the van, and when Mackin high sided the van, and 
orders were given for him to surrender.  Mackin never complied with any of the orders

given to him to surrender.   Mackin was noncompliant throughout this incident and 
never gave any indication he was going to surrender.  A concern of his during this 
incident was not being able to see what Mackin was doing, and being unable to 
determine if Mackin was pointing the handgun at them while Mackin was moving 
around in the van.    
 
During this incident, he never had any reason to believe the handgun Mackin had was 
anything other than a real firearm, which could cause death or serious bodily harm.  He 
believed that when Mackin was raising the handgun toward officers, Mackin had the 
ability, intent, and opportunity to gravely harm or kill him and his fellow officers.   
 
After our interview, Officer Armstrong indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about the 
incident other than his attorney and had not viewed body-worn camera footage before the 
interview.  Officer Armstrong was offered an opportunity to review his body-worn camera 
footage; however, he declined.  Officer Armstrong had nothing further to add, so we ended our 
interview.   
 
On Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1115 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Borg and his

He attended a basic police academy and worked for the Alameda County Sheriff's 
Department as a Deputy Sheriff for 12 ½ years.  He has been a police officer for the 
Antioch Police Department for 4 ½ years and has attended several P.O.S.T. certified 
trainings in his career.  He is currently enrolled in Cal Coast College for his bachelor's 
degree.   
 
After Officer Borg provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what happened 
that led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Borg in substance told us the following:  
 
Officer Borg's Interview:  
He had a full night's sleep the night before this incident and was well rested.  He was 
dressed in the APD class ""C"" uniform, which is their BDU uniform.  He was wearing an 
outer load vest cover with APD patches on each shoulder and an embroidered star on 
his left chest.  He was wearing his duty belt, and carrying his department issued firearm.  
His firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 department issued firearm, which was fully loaded 
and has a capacity of 17 rounds in the magazine.  He had one round in the chamber 
which gave him a total of 18 rounds, which is how he was carrying it on the day of the 
incident.  He also had two additional magazines with him that were both loaded to a 
capacity of 17 rounds each.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, which 
was activated during the incident.    
 
He is a training officer and Officer Armstrong is his trainee.  After the briefing on Sunday, 
October 1, 2023, he gave Officer Armstrong a tour of the department, as this was Officer 
Armstrong’s first day on patrol.  While touring the police department, he heard the 
details of Officer Marques' call with a possible stolen vehicle and an unresponsive man 
sleeping in a different vehicle, with a gun in plain view.   He and Officer Armstrong 
respond to the location in their fully marked patrol vehicle.   
 
Upon arrival at A Street and W. 3rd Street, he parked their patrol vehicle on W. 3rd 
Street.  He could see 2-3 patrol vehicles with their emergency lights on, parked in the 
driveway facing the carport area of the apartments.  The officers were conducting a 
high-risk stop and ordering a person out of a van.   He and Officer Armstrong

immediately got out of their patrol vehicle and took cover behind the patrol vehicles in 
the driveway area.   He spoke with Officer Dibble who confirmed that the van was the 
involved vehicle.     
 
At this point, he took a position on the passenger side of a patrol vehicle, and directed 
Officer Armstrong to stay with him.  Both he and Officer Armstrong drew their sidearms 
and pointed them at the blue van.  Officers began giving orders to the person in the blue 
van to surrender and come out with his hands up (this person was later identified as 
Mackin).   After a few moments, he saw Mackin move into the driver's seat of the blue 
van.  It was difficult to see into the van because there was a curtain dividing the front 
seat and the rear cargo area.  The side windows of the van were also tinted, making it 
difficult to see into the van.  Mackin did not comply with their orders to give up during 
the 2-3 minutes Mackin was being ordered out of the van.  All the officers were in full 
uniform, and the patrol vehicles were fully marked, with the emergency lights on.   
 
At this point, Mackin moved into the driver's seat, and he could hear Mackin trying to 
start the van.  Officers gave Mackin orders to not start the van and to come out with his 
hands up; however, Mackin did not comply.  Mackin put the van into drive and 
accelerated, driving towards the officers.  Mackin then veered away from the officers 
and tried to drive over the curbed parking lot and through the vegetation in an attempt 
to drive onto A Street.  Mackin hit a metal utility box and got the van stuck in a grassy 
area.  Mackin began to reverse the van and drive it forward in an attempt to free it.       
 
At this point, things became chaotic with officers talking over each other and giving 
Mackin commands to surrender.  He quickly returned to his patrol vehicle, in the event 
Mackin was able to free the van and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Once he realized Mackin 
was unable to free the van, he returned to his position of cover at the patrol vehicle 
parked in the driveway.  He noticed that Officer Marques had his police K9 out.  At this 
point, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles in the area behind the van.  
Officer Mulholland had the 40mm less lethal deployed.  They were trying to deescalate 
the situation by shooting out the driver's side window in an attempt to gain Mackin's 
compliance with their orders to surrender.

He yelled out to Officer Mulholland to have one person give commands, so it wouldn't 
be so chaotic and Mackin could understand.  He was at the rear of the van; 
unfortunately, the rear windows were tinted, and he could not see where Mackin was.   
He requested dispatch contact the Brentwood Police Department to see if they had stop 
sticks available in the event Mackin was able to get the van free.   
 
After 2-3 minutes, he saw the side passenger door open and Mackin jumped out of the 
van.  Mackin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and shorts with the hood up over his 
head.  He could see that Mackin had his left hand in the front pocket of the sweatshirt or 
the front of his waistband.  He started yelling orders for Mackin to surrender and to put 
his hands up.  He yelled out that Mackin had exited the van, and he was now reaching 
for something.  He and Mackin made eye contact and Mackin fled eastbound across the 
curbline of the parking lot and onto A Street.   
 
He gave chase and took an angle to the right in an attempt to cut Mackin off.  As he ran 
up a dirt embankment, he tripped and fell to the ground.  He quickly got up and 
continued to pursue Mackin.   He could now see Mackin was running with a handgun in 
his left hand.  As Mackin fled from him, Mackin turned and looked at him while holding 
the handgun in his left hand.  He believed that Mackin was attempting to gain a sight 
picture of the pursuing officers.  At this time, he felt he needed to use lethal force to 
stop Mackin and prevent him from shooting any officers.  He believed Mackin had the 
intention to harm someone, and Mackin could cause death or harm to officers or 
citizens.  He then fired at least one round at Mackin.   He estimates he was 15-20 feet 
away from Mackin at the time he initially engaged him.   
 
Mackin ran a short distance and then collapsed on the sidewalk on the north side of A 
Street.  When Mackin fell to the ground, he fell in a seated position on the sidewalk.  
Mackin was facing him and his fellow officers.  He recalled Officer Marques was to his 
immediate left and they were close together.  Mackin was now holding the handgun in 
his right hand and began raising it, at which time he could see the silver barrel of the gun 
pointed at him.   He thought Mackin fired a shot at him because he heard a shot come

from Mackin's direction, but he did not see a muzzle flash or see the handgun recoil.  
Based on this, he fired several rounds at Mackin.   
 
After firing at Mackin, Mackin got onto his feet again, and was still holding the handgun 
in his right hand.  He conducted a tactical reload, to make sure he had a fully loaded 
firearm.  After the tactical reload, he pointed his handgun at Mackin, however, he does 
not recall if he fired any more shots.  Within seconds, Mackin started to flee from 
officers again.  Mackin then threw the handgun over his head in a northern direction.   
He could see that Mackin was no longer armed or had anything in his hands, so he 
transitioned to his taser and holstered his firearm.   He could see Mackin was slowing 
down, and he began giving Mackin commands to get onto the ground.  After Mackin 
discarded the handgun, there were no additional shots fired by officers.   
 
He could see Officer Marques' K9 run passed him.  The K9 began circling Mackin; 
however, the K9 never engaged Mackin because of the distraction of Mackin’s dog.  At 
this point, Mackin slowed down and collapsed onto the ground.  Mackin was 
handcuffed, and officers began requesting a medical bag, and emergency medical 
personnel to respond.  They also began securing the crime scene.   
 
After our interview, Officer Borg indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about this

SUMMARY: 
 
On July 21, 2023, Officer
 filed an EEO complaint against Sergeant David RAMIREZ, 
 The complaint was received by SDPD Internal Affairs Unit and a formal 
investigation was launched.   
 
On August 20, 2023, at approximately 1545 hours, Officer 
 received a message via Instagram in 
a group chat that consisted of Officer 
 Officer 
 and Sergeant RAMIREZ. The 
message was sent by Sergeant RAMIREZ and was a video meme of an elephant with a large penis with 
the caption that read “Sometimes you get more than you originally wanted” with a laughing emoji. 
Officer 
 was offended by the message due to its penis reference and initially interpreted the 
meme to be some kind of sexual message from Sergeant RAMIREZ.  Officer 
 then believed it 
was a threat of retaliation from Sergeant RAMIREZ because of the first EEO complaint filed by Officer 
 on July 21, 2023.   
 
Officer 
 was later interviewed and desired a formal investigation be conducted for sexual 
harassment and retaliatory harassment.

 INVESTIGATION: 
 
On August 20, 2023, this EEO complaint was filed by Officer 
   
 
On August 22, 2023, I discovered a voice message on my work phone from Officer 
  The 
message was left on August 20, 2023, at 1622 hours.  Officer 
 stated in the voicemail he had 
just received a “disturbing direct message” on Instagram from Sergeant RAMIREZ. Officer 
 
said he had taken a screenshot of the message to show me and that it was “extremely inappropriate.”  
 
I was notified by Lieutenant SCHMOTTLACH that an EEO complaint had been received from Officer 
 the day before on August 21, 2023.  I reviewed the Discrimination/Harassment Control Form 
completed by Captain DEL TORO and saw it was the same incident that Officer 
 described in 
his voice message. The form had the following summary:  
 
On July 21, 2023, Officer 
 reported to the Northwestern Command Staff that 
 
 David Ramirez referred to him as a ""bitch"" in a conversation between the 
two. Officer 
 took offense to the remark and reported the incident. On August 20th, 2023 
while at work around 1545 hours, 
 received a group message on Instagram. The group 
consisted of Officer 
 Officer 
 and was sent by Sergeant David 
Ramirez. The message was of an elephant with a large penis with the caption that read 
""Sometimes you get more than you originally wanted"". Officer 
 took this to mean ""I am the 
big dick here"" or if he was going to get the ""dick"" meaning he was going to get screwed from the 
allegation. In either case, he believes this message is delivering the message that when this initial 
investigation is over, he is going to be retaliated against. Lastly, Officer 
 said he has not 
received a message on that group since April of 2023 and thinks the timing on this message is 
consistent with the initial allegation he has filed against Sergeant Ramirez.  
 
On August 25, 2023, at 1414 hours, I conducted an EEO intake interview with Officer 
 in an 
interview room in the Internal Affairs Unit at SDPD Headquarters.  I digitally recorded the interview and 
later uploaded the audio recording into the IA PRO case file.   
 
During the interview, Officer 
 provided the video meme that was sent by Sergeant RAMIREZ.  
I watched the video and saw it began with an elephant walking toward the camera with the camera 
positioned at or near ground level.  A caption overlayed the video that stated, “Sometimes you get more 
than you originally wanted” with a laughing emoji. The video then continued with the elephant walking 
past the camera, at which time the elephant’s penis came into view very near the camera as the elephant 
walked by:

EEO Complaint Intake Interview: Officer 
 
 
On August 25, 2023, at 1414 hours, I interviewed Officer 
 in an interview room within the 
Internal Affairs Unit at SDPD Headquarters. The interview was digitally recorded. Internal Affairs D/Sgt. 
Nathan CHAMBERS #7021 was also present in the interview.  
 
While all efforts were made to be accurate, for exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the 
digital recording. The recording is 12 minutes and 59 seconds in length. Through questions and answers, 
Officer 
 essentially stated the following not necessarily in chronological order: 
 
Immediately after the first incident I reported concerning Sergeant RAMIREZ on July 21, 2023, I 
blocked Sergeant RAMIREZ on all social media. The only social media platform I have is 
Instagram.  
 
On Sunday, August 20, 2023, I was at work and sitting in the lounge area 
 
 when my phone alerted me that I had an Instagram message.  The message was sent in a 
group chat, and the notification said that I had one person in the group chat blocked.  In order to 
view the message, I had to accept. The group chat consisted of myself, Sergeant RAMIREZ, and 
Officer 
  
 
Since it was sent by Sergeant RAMIREZ, and I know he was made aware of the previous 
complaint, I was curious and concerned about what he had sent so I accepted the message and I 
saw what he had sent.   
 
The message was a video meme that had text overlaying the video that said, “Sometimes you get 
more than you originally wanted.” The video itself was an elephant walking toward the camera, 
and the camera was positioned on the ground. As the text fades, the elephant walks by the camera 
and a large elephant penis drags over the view of the camera.  
 
“Initially, when I saw that, I was kind of in shock. And thought initially, this being sexual in 
nature, that it was like a meaning of like ‘you’re about to get the dick.’ And then the more I 
thought about it, I took it extremely threatening.” Like, since I had made a complaint against him. 
Also, because the initial complaint was being investigated as a procedure and not EEO, that he 
felt he had won and was going to get back at me.  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Officer 
 to explain what he meant when he said he 
initially interpreted the video message to mean “you’re about to get the dick.” Officer 
 
essentially stated the following:  
 
Well, the message said, “Sometimes you get more than you wanted,” like he was about to give me 
the dick.  I took it sexually, which was off-putting. And then that thought flipped to like, ok, is he

talking about he’s going to drag his dick over my face? Or am I going to get fucked in the ass? I 
took it as sexual in nature, which like I said was off-putting.  And then the more I looked at the 
message, I thought – this was a group chat that was created by Officer 
 which I’ve 
contributed very little to. I would only comment, and I never sent any memes or videos.  
 
At this point during the interview, I confirmed with Officer 
 that this message was sent in a 
group chat between him, Officer 
 and Sergeant RAMIREZ. I asked Officer 
 if there 
was anything associated with the video that showed it was intended to be directed at him, or if anything 
else was sent to identify that it was intended for a specific recipient. Officer 
 essentially stated 
the following:  
 
No, there wasn’t. But I just find it funny that the last correspondence on this group chat was way 
back in April. And if you’re familiar with how Instagram works, if you haven’t received a message 
since way back in April, you have to really dig down deep to send a message specifically on that 
thread. And, knowing Officer 
 and Sergeant RAMIREZ’ relationship, I find it hard to 
believe that there has not been any Instagram correspondence between them since April.  And, if 
Sergeant RAMIREZ meant to send that just to Officer 
 he knows how Instagram works 
and could have sent that as a message just to him.  But to have to dig down to a message thread 
back in April and click on that specific message thread and send that meme, I took that as the 
message was directed at me, but in a way that could be covered up. Basically, I think you have to 
jump through a lot of hoops to send that message on an old group thread, so I don’t believe it was 
an accident.  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Officer 
 why he thought the video message was a 
threat. Officer 
 essentially stated the following:  
 
The text itself led me to believe it was a threat. When you want to use slang terms to tell someone 
you’re going to get back at them, you say “You’re going to get fucked in the ass.”  
 
At this point during the interview, I clarified my question to Officer 
 and asked him why he 
believed Sergeant RAMIREZ would have a reason to send him a threat at all. Officer 
 
essentially stated the following:  
 
Due to the initial complaint that I filed against him. And this was his way he was saying he was 
going to eventually get back at me, considering the initial complaint was not being investigated as 
an EEO. So, I think Sergeant RAMIREZ feels the complaint is a “nothing burger” and he’ll get 
past it.  And once he does, “you’re going to get more than you wanted” – to use the terms in the 
video.  
 
After I received the video, I called you (Detective Sergeant NIELSEN) and I also notified my 
sergeant, Sergeant 
 I don’t remember if I contacted Sergeant 
 first or you, but

it was pretty much simultaneously.  And as soon as I notified Sergeant 
 the EEO control 
forms were completed, and the process was started to document the complaint.   
 
 I blocked Sergeant RAMIREZ on Instagram, but I don’t know if he blocked me back.  Instagram 
does not notify the blocked party that they have been blocked, so I don’t know. That also means 
Sergeant RAMIREZ would not have been notified by Instagram that I had blocked him.  
 
No one responded to the video message after it was sent. There has been no other messages or 
activity on that group thread.  
 
My nickname on the Instagram thread is 
 something is Officer 
   
 
I would like this complaint investigated formally.  
 
I concluded the interview.

Subject Officer Interview:  Sergeant David RAMIREZ #6702 
 
On September 20, 2023, at 0959 hours, I interviewed Sergeant RAMIREZ in an interview room within 
the Internal Affairs Unit at SDPD Headquarters. The interview was digitally recorded. Present as Sergeant 
RAMIREZ’ representative was 
 Internal Affairs D/Sgt. CHAMBERS 
#7021 was also present in the interview.  
 
I read Sergeant RAMIREZ the Subject Officer “Sworn Personnel Admonishment (with Lybarger/Garrity 
Warning).”  Sergeant RAMIREZ and I then signed the admonishment and I provided Sergeant RAMIREZ 
a copy of the signed Admonishment form.   
 
While all efforts were made to be accurate, for exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the 
digital recording. The recording is 17 minutes and 19 seconds in length. Through questions and answers, 
Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the following not necessarily in chronological order: 
 
I have been with the San Diego Police Department for about 15 years and am currently assigned 
to Northwestern Division. I have been at Northwestern Division since I promoted to sergeant 
about 2 years ago.  
  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ, “On Sunday, August 20, 2023, did you 
send a video message in an Instagram group message thread to Officer 
 and Officer 
 
 Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the following: 
 
I did send the meme to the group chat, I learned after the fact.  But I don’t remember the date.  
 
At this point during the interview, I played the elephant video meme provided to me by Officer 
  I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ if the video I played was the same one he sent on August 20, 
2023.  Sergeant RAMIREZ said, “Yes.”  
 
I then asked Sergeant RAMIREZ why he sent the video to Officer 
  Sergeant RAMIREZ 
essentially stated the following: 
 
I didn’t know that it was as group chat. I sent it to three friends of mine, including Officer 
 When I sent it to Officer 
 I did not see that there was multiple…I had previously 
blocked and unfollowed Officer 
 and I think he did the same to me.  So, I did not think 
any communication with him was possible. So, he was not in mind at all when I sent that.  He was 
not an intended person to send it to. I did not know that he could even receive that.   
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ to explain how this video meme was sent 
in an Instagram group thread that included Officer 
  Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the

Well, I’m not the most technological person.  When I learned it happened, I went back to try and 
figure out how could it have happened.  What I think happened was me, Officer 
 and 
Officer 
 were in a group chat together.  When we blocked and unfollowed each other, I 
can’t see anything on his page, and he can’t see anything on mine.  If I see something I want to 
share, I click “share” and select the people I want to share it with – and I only saw the names of 
the people I wanted to send it to.  I did not see Officer 
 name in there.  I thought it was 
only Officer 
 name.  Officer 
 Instagram moniker is kind of long, so I don’t know 
if was cut off so I couldn’t see it, or if it was invisible because maybe Officer 
 
deactivated his account, and if he reactivated it then maybe he appeared again.  I don’t really 
know.   
 
As soon as I heard about this, I called my captain first and told him I had just got wind of it and he 
needed to know about it because it’s going to “blow up.” I couldn’t think of a safer environment 
than the captain’s office with the captain present, so I asked if it was possible to have a meeting 
with Officer 
 
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ the following series of questions: 
 
NIELSEN: “Did you send the video in response to a complaint filed by Officer 
 against you?” 
 
RAMIREZ: “No.”  
 
NIELSEN: “Was this video intended to threaten or intimidate Officer 
 
 
RAMIREZ: “No.”  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ what he did after he sent the video.  
Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the following: 
 
As soon as I heard about this, I called my captain told him I had just complicated matters for 
myself and the division.  I told him I had sent the video to Officer 
 and did not know how 
it happened, but regardless it was not intended for him and sent accidentally.  I told the captain I 
would like to sit down with Officer 
 and Officer 
 in the captain’s office and 
show Officer 
 it was accidental and how it happened.  I did not think Officer 
 
was willing to do it, but I would like to try.  A meeting with Officer 
 and myself never 
happened.   
 
At this point during the interview, I went back to the topic of the video itself and asked Sergeant 
RAMIREZ if the caption “Sometimes you get more than you originally wanted” with the laughing emoji 
was referencing something specific in the video.  Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the following:

Well, it’s the elephant penis.  The account that published the video is a wildlife photography guy 
with other videos of like lions and other wildlife. Those other videos don’t have captions, they are 
just regular videos of wildlife.   
 
I did not add the caption to the video, it was just like that.  Because the other videos are regular 
wildlife, so in this video the guy was intending to capture an elephant, but just not the penis erect 
like that.  So, to put “sometimes you get more than what you wanted” with a laughing 
emoji…that’s not something that I added. That’s something that was in the video, and I just shared 
that video.  I assume the wildlife photographer guy added it because that’s how it was when it 
went viral.  Like 5 million people have viewed it now.  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ what message he was trying to 
communicate by sending the video.  Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated the following: 
 
It was just shock.  I’ve been to the zoo and I’ve seen elephants, but I’ve never seen an elephant like 
that before.  And I was like, “Ha.” And I forwarded it to my friends. Like I said, the video has like 
5 million views now, so I’m not alone in that.  It’s interesting.  
 
NIELSEN: “You said, ‘Ha.’ Did you think it was funny? 
 
I was shocked. It was more of like an impactful thing. I thought that it was worthy to share with 
two of the people I normally share stuff with.  I mean, bad car crashes and stuff like that.  This is 
just things that are just impactful that I want to share.  And like I said, there are three people I 
share stuff with.  And this was intended to be sent to those three persons, and Officer 
 
being one of them.  I did not realize it was a group.  I did not think it was possible for Officer 
 and I to communicate still.   
 
If I knew there was any possible way Officer 
 could see a video or anything from me, I 
wouldn’t do it. Because, even prior to his first complaint, he had stopped communicating. So, I 
had kind of tapered off the communication and the only communication I had with him was 
 
   
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ, “So, at this point in time, your 
communication with Officer 
 was purely work-related?” Sergeant RAMIREZ essentially stated 
the following: 
 
Yes.  The only communication was the necessary work-related communications that were part of 
my responsibility 
  They were not on Instagram or anything like that, just 
messages from my phone to the work group text of my squad.

I did not really have any personal relationship with Officer 
 at that point.  Even after he 
walked away from me after the incident on July 21, 2023, I had tried to get with him after the fact.  
I’m in SLI (leadership training) and I have been trying to improve the squad and manage 
expectations.  But I found out he wanted to file a formal complaint against me for the incident on 
July 21st, so that’s when the communication stopped.  
 
When it comes to sharing that video on Instagram I think the way it works is, I saw the video, I go 
to “forward,” I forward it to the three people I forward to, I send, and that sends.  And then when 
they click on the video it will open up to whoever originally posted that video. So, when the 
receiver gets the video and clicks on it, it goes to that page and all the comments on the video. And 
you can then click on the Instagram account and see all the other wildlife videos and stuff.  
 
At this point during the interview, I asked Sergeant RAMIREZ, “Do you consider penis-related jokes 
appropriate for a Department supervisor to share with their subordinates?” Sergeant RAMIREZ 
essentially stated the following: 
 
I don’t think that was a joke.  Like I said, it was a wildlife account, there’s an elephant with its 
penis erect.  And I’d never seen that, and it was impactful to me. I thought that, since it’s gone 
viral, it’s been impactful to a lot of people, and they forward it.   
 
“I think the text caption made things, kind of like, complicated, not only in my case, but I think 
even if you…” 
 
NIELSEN: “Well, and the inclusion of a laughing emoji would be an indicator that this was to be meant 
as humorous, would you agree? 
 
That’s the question for whoever made the caption. What I saw, I was impacted. You don’t see it 
until the very end, and you’re like “dang,” you know.  I’ve taken my kids to the zoo and I’ve never 
seen that. So, it wasn’t…I sent it because it was impactful.  And I shared it with the people I 
normally share things with.  I just didn’t know he was in that text thread.  
 
I concluded the interview.

All employees shall be treated equally without regard to race, color, gender, creed, 
religion, national origin, age, marital status, ancestry, medical condition (history of 
cancer), pregnancy, disability, transgender status, or sexual orientation in all employment 
matters, including, but not limited to, promotions, transfers, job rotation, training, work 
assignments, hiring, merit increases, overtime, awards, and discipline.  
 
B. Harassment-free Work Environment  
 
1. All employees shall be provided a work environment free from harassment. 
Behavior constitutes harassment, as defined by this policy, when it is unwelcome 
and unsolicited, offends or otherwise causes distress, and is undertaken because of 
a person’s race, color, gender, creed, religion, national origin, age, marital status, 
ancestry, medical condition, disability, pregnancy, transgender status or sexual 
orientation. Examples include the use of derogatory comments, slurs, jokes, or 
derogatory pictures, cartoons, or posters.  
 
2. The City of San Diego and the Police Department have a 100% Response Policy 
regarding harassment. The Department prohibits any harassment of employees, as 
defined above, and actively responds to all allegations of violations of this 
procedure. Such inappropriate conduct may be in violation of this policy and result 
in discipline the first time such behavior occurs. Prior incidents of harassment can 
be considered when assessing the facts and circumstances of a later complaint.  
 
3. Whether an alleged action constitutes harassment, as defined above, will be 
determined on a case-by-case basis by assessing the entire record and the totality of 
the circumstances. Factors, such as the nature of the behavior and the context in 
which the alleged incidents occurred, will be considered in assessing the allegations 
and in determining the appropriate resolution. 
 
J. Retaliation  
 
1. Retaliation is defined as an adverse employment action taken against an 
employee because that employee complained of discrimination or participated in an 
EEO investigation.  
 
2. An adverse employment action can include, but is not limited to, unwanted 
transfers, change in work assignment or location, denial of leave requests, 
demotions, negative performance evaluations, unsupported discipline, ostracism, 
harassment, or other actions that adversely affect the work environment.

3. Retaliation is illegal and should be reported immediately. The Department will 
not tolerate retaliation. Any employee found to have retaliated against another 
Department member would be subject to discipline.  
 
Officer 
 stated during his intake interview he believed Sergeant RAMIREZ intentionally sent 
the message to him because he believed Sergeant RAMIREZ knows how Instagram works and that 
Sergeant RAMIREZ would have had to “jump through a lot of hoops” to send it in the group thread that 
included him.  Officer 
 did say there was nothing included with or specifically about the video 
message that indicated it was meant to be directed at him, but Officer 
 said he still felt the 
message was directed at him and was only sent in the group thread to “cover up” that fact.  
 
Sergeant RAMIREZ stated during his interview he never intended to send the video to Officer 
 
and that his sending it in the group thread was an accident.  Sergeant RAMIREZ said he was “not the 
most technological person” and did not think sending anything to Officer 
 was even possible 
because he said he had blocked and unfollowed Officer 
 after the first complaint was filed 
against him.  Sergeant RAMIREZ stated he shared the video by clicking “share” and then selected the 
names of the individuals he intended to send it to, one of them being Officer 
  Sergeant 
RAMIREZ said he never saw Officer 
 name at all when he was sharing the video.  Sergeant 
RAMIREZ speculated that maybe Officer 
 name was cut off due to Officer 
 account 
name being long, or that Officer 
 name was invisible due to Officer 
 deactivating 
his account and reactivating it later.  
 
An allegation of retaliation requires a causal connection between the engagement in protected activity and 
the perceived retaliatory behavior or action.  In this case, there is no evidence to support or refute whether 
Sergeant RAMIREZ intentionally sent the video message to Officer 
  Both Officer 
 
and Sergeant RAMIREZ’ statements concerning how and why the message was sent are plausible, with 
no way to prove or disprove either claim.   
 
Therefore, this allegation is NOT SUSTAINED.

2. EEO Sexual Harassment – SUSTAINED 
 
Sergeant RAMIREZ sexually harassed Officer 
 when he sent him a video meme 
message via Instagram. 
 
On August 20, 2023, at approximately 1545 hours, Officer 
 received a message via Instagram in 
a group chat that consisted of Officer 
 Officer 
 and Sergeant RAMIREZ. The 
message was sent by Sergeant RAMIREZ and was a video meme of an elephant with a large penis with 
the caption that read “Sometimes you get more than you originally wanted” with a laughing emoji.  
 
Officer 
 was offended by the message due to its penis reference and interpreted the meme to be 
some kind of sexual message from Sergeant RAMIREZ.

and in determining the appropriate resolution. 
 
C. Impact vs. Intent 
 
1. 
Whether or not harassment occurred depends not on whether the act was intended 
to cause harm, but the impact of the act on the individual’s employment or work 
environment.  For example, a person who teases in a sexual or racial manner, or 
tells sexual or racial jokes, may create an offensive work environment for another 
worker even though the person intended such action merely to be “good fun.”  This 
applies to the field, as well as office positions.  If one’s behavior is harassing to an 
individual or a group of individuals, it will not suffice that the harasser failed to 
recognize the behavior as harassing. 
 
2. 
It is not a requirement that the complainant be the intended target of the offensive 
conduct.  Witnessing offensive behavior between other employees may be grounds 
for complaint.

D. Sexual Harassment  
 
1. Sexual harassment is a form of illegal gender discrimination. It is defined by law 
as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual 
or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:  
 
a. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term 
or condition of an individual's employment;  
 
b. Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for 
employment decisions affecting that employee; or,  
 
c. Such conduct has the effect of unreasonably interfering with an 
individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or 
offensive working environment.  
 
2. Unwelcome is used in the sense that the offended employee did not solicit or 
incite the conduct and regarded it as undesirable or offensive.  
 
3. The following are examples of sexual harassment. Behavior that constitutes 
sexual harassment as defined by this policy is not limited to these examples:  
 
a. Verbal harassment - sexual innuendo, sexually suggestive comments, 
jokes, teasing of a sexual nature, discussing sexual exploits, spreading 
rumors of a sexual connotation, or continued requests for social or sexual 
contact.  
 
b. Physical harassment - unwelcome contact, touching, or impeding 
movement.  
 
c. Visual harassment - sexually suggestive or derogatory posters, videos, 
cartoons, drawings, documents, writings, electronic mail, texting, staring, or 
leering.  
 
d. Sexual favors - unwanted sexual advances or conditioning an 
employment benefit on an exchange of sexual favors. 
 
Officer 
 stated he was at work and on duty when he received the video meme from Sergeant 
RAMIREZ.  Officer 
 said he was “in shock” when he first viewed the video and saw it as being 
“sexual in nature.”  Officer 
 said he took the message “sexually” and interpreted it to mean that 
Sergeant RAMIREZ was going to engage Officer 
 in a sex act.

Sergeant RAMIREZ stated in his interview he decided to share the video was because it “shocked” him 
and he was “impacted” by it.  Sergeant RAMIREZ recognized that the focal point of the video, and what 
the caption overlaying the video was referencing, was the elephant’s penis. Sergeant RAMIREZ said he 
did not see the video as a joke, despite the “laughing out loud” emoji at the end of the caption, and stated 
he chose to share the video because he was impacted by the video being an elephant with its penis erect.   
 
Sergeant RAMIREZ also stated he did not intend to send the video to Officer 
  Sergeant 
RAMIREZ said at the time the video was sent he did not have a personal relationship with Officer 
 and the only communication he would send Officer 
 was necessary, “work-related” 
communications. 
 
As explained in Allegation #1, whether Sergeant RAMIREZ intentionally sent the video to Officer 
 cannot be proved or disproved.  However, there is no dispute that Sergeant RAMIREZ sent the 
video and was received by Officer 
 since Officer 
 was part of the group thread in 
which the video was sent. The message was unwelcomed by Officer 
 who at that point in time 
was only receiving work-related communications from Sergeant RAMIREZ.  Officer 
 who was 
at work at the time, was offended by the sexual nature of the video and reported the incident to his 
command.   
 
Based on the totality of the circumstances, and regardless whether Officer 
 was an intended 
recipient of the video message, it was reasonable for Officer 
 upon seeing the video to believe 
he experienced sexual harassment by Sergeant RAMIREZ.     
 
Therefore, this allegation is SUSTAINED.

Provide a brief description of the alleged Equal Employment Opportunity violation:

 
 
  

On July 21, 2023, Officer [ME reported to the Northwestern Command Staff or
GE David Ramirez referred to him as a “bitch” in a conversation between the two. Officer ook
offense to the remark and reported the incident. On August 20"", 2023 while at work around 1545 hours,
received a group message on Instagram. The group consisted of Officer [ig Officer

and was sent by Sergeant David Ramirez. The message was of an elephant with a large penis
with the caption that read “Sometimes you get more than you originally wanted”. Officer took this to
mean “I am the big dick here” or if he was going to get the “dick” meaning he was going to get screwed from
the allegation. In either case, he believes this message is delivering the message that when this initial
investigation is over, he is going to be retaliated against. Lastly, Officer [said he has not received a
message on that group since April of 2023 and thinks the timing on this message is consistent with the initia
allegation he has filed against Sergeant Ramirez.

EVIDENCE OF INJURY:

The subject has sustained four gunshot wounds. There are Taser prongs in the
right buttock and the right lower back.

Gunshot wound #1: This is a wound to the right of center in the chest that is 1 cm
from midline to its inner edge. It is 56 inches from the bare heel. There is a
corresponding hole in the shirt. The wound has a partial rim of soot and searing
from approximately 7-9-10 o'clock that has a width of 1 cm. There is also a
triangle shaped pattern of soot extending from approximately 3 o'clock that
progressively widens toward midline and measures 2 x 2 cm. The marginal
abrasion is the faint. There appear to be 3 to 4 powder stipple marks at
approximately 9 o'clock, 5 mm lateral from the soot margin, that cover an area of
1 cm in diameter. The stipples average less than 1 mm. The exit wound is in the
left axilla 57.5 inches from the bare heel and measures 2.1 x 2 cm. There is no
corresponding hole in the shirt. It would appear that the projectile was trapped

 

 

inside the shirt and moved toward the anterior chest when the body was moved,
where the fully expanded projectile was recovered beneath the shirt. The wound
course would be from right to left, front to back, and upward. Gunshot wound #1
shatters the upper sternum and enters the chest cavity at the level of left second
rib. The right chest cavity is unremarkable. The left chest cavity contains 500-600
ml of blood. The projectile exited the left chest cavity at the level of the fifth and
sixth ribs producing a 2 cm in diameter hole. It then exited the skin as described.
it perforated the upper lobe of the left lung. No injuries to the heart, aorta or the
left carotid artery and left subclavian artery were found.

Gunshot wound #2: This is a grazing wound in the left lower abdomen. The
upper edge is 43 inches from the bare heel, begins 5 cm to the left of midline,
and has a downward course from medial to lateral. It measures 4.5 x 1.7 cm and
has corresponding holes in the shirt as well as in the left front pocket of the
camouflage pattern pants.

Gunshot wound #3: This is a wound that is a perforating wound in the right
forearm just below the elbow. The entrance wound measures 1.1 x 1 cm and has
a halo of soot around it that is most pronounced on the upper outer edge for 3 x 2
cm. The exit perforation is located 4 cm from it and is an irregular stellate wound
with several skin tags around it that measures 3 x 2.5 cm. A probe connects the
two wounds. There is damage to the head of the ulna bone and imaging studies
show what appears to be a fragment of retained projectile. The wound is
examined internally and shows on exploring the wound that the ulna is shattered.
The largest fragment of the projectile is recovered along with two smaller
fragments of lead and copper jacket.

Gunshot wound #4: It is a perforating wound. The entrance wound is in the
anterior lateral left arm 12 cm below the top of the shoulder. The wound
measures 1.1 x 1 cm, has faint marginal abrasion, and shows faint stippling on
the lower and medial edge for 2.5 x 2 cm. The exit perforation is in the posterior
lateral arm 12 cm above and behind the entrance wound. The exit wound
measures 3 x 1.3 cm. The wound course is upward, front to back, and courses
tangentially underneath the skin without damaging the humerus bone.

pancreas has the usual light tan, lobular architecture. No areas of hemorrhage,
necrosis or calcification are identified on sectioning. The adrenals have the usual
bright yellow cortices and grey to brown medullary areas. No lesions are
identified on sectioning.

GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:

The right and left kidney weights are normal. Both renal capsules strip with ease
to reveal smooth and glistening, dark red cortical surfaces. Sectioning through
the kidneys discloses adequate cortical widths with distinct corticomedullary
junctions, and no areas of hemorrhage, necrosis or inflammation involving the
renal pyramids. The urinary collecting system is normal. The bladder contains
approximately 40 ml of clear yellow urine. The bladder mucosa is free of lesions.
The penis is circumcised and free of skin lesions. Both testes are descended
within the scrotum and palpably free of masses.

EXTREMITIES:
The extremities are normal except as described above under evidence of injury.

HISTOLOGY:
No tissue samples are saved.

EVIDENCE SAVED:
Items of evidence taken are described in the law enforcement reports and consist
of clothing, personal effects, and the recovered bullet and bullet fragments

TOXICOLOGY:
Routine fluid samples are saved and toxicology is requested.

CORONER’S INVESTIGATION NARRATIVE 
 
 
Coroner Case #: 23-097 
 
Synopsis: 
 
On 09/09/2023, at approximately 0600 hours, I was dispatched to assist Detective Tucker with 
an Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) incident that occurred near the intersection of Lemee Lane 
and Frank Wilson in Mariposa County. Detective Tucker stated he was the lead investigator on 
the OIS but requested I handle the Coroner Investigation. I was advised that Deputy Holt 
confirmed that 
 
 Logan was deceased at 0322 hours on 09/09/2023 as a result of a 
single gunshot wound to the chest. A&R Mortuary services were requested, and later 
transported

Details: (Witness Statement(s), Terminal Event, Medical History):   
 
On 09/09/2023, at approximately 0600 hours, I was dispatched to assist Detective Tucker with 
an Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) incident that occurred near the intersection of Lemee Lane 
and Frank Wilson in Mariposa County. Detective Tucker stated he was the lead investigator on 
the OIS but requested I handle the Coroner Investigation. Upon arrival, I was advised that the 
OIS occurred earlier this morning when 
 Logan advanced on a deputy while holding a 
knife. 
 was then struck by a single gunshot wound in his chest causing him to collapse. 
Deputies attempted life saving measures but were unsuccessful. Deputy Holt pronounced 
 Logan as deceased at 0322 hours on 09/09/2023.  
 
California Department of Justice was already in progress of processing the scene before I 
arrived. I then responded with Detective Collins to 
 to notify 
the next of kin, 
 
. 
 is 
’s father. Upon contacting 
, he was 
advised that 
 was deceased as a result of an incident involving law enforcement. 
 
responded by stating that last night, 
 was not allowed to stay at the apartment due to his 
uncle not wanting him there. 
 stated 
 has been abusing methamphetamine, which 
is the reason he was not permitted to stay at the apartment. When 
 left the apartment that 
evening, he told 
 “If anything bad happens, just know that I love you.” 
 also added 
that he has been telling 
 he needs to self-admit himself to the hospital to get help, but 
never did so. 
 stated that 
 has a history of depression issues. 
’s 
stepbrother, 
 
, was also at the apartment during the notification. 
 stated that 
 has been abusing methamphetamine and has recently had multiple hallucinations stating 
people are chasing him. 
 stated that he went to bed last night 09/08/2023 at 
approximately 2200 hours and recalls 
 being “high” when he left the apartment prior to 
him going to bed.

Narrative
Narrative
On 11-29-23, at about 2234 hours, Officer Whitmore and Officer J. Flores were dispatched to the above 
apartment complex for a reported domestic violence incident.  The reporting party/victim stated the father of 
her child ""socked"" her on her mouth and her lip was bleeding.  The victim later updated the call that the male 
suspect was back at her apartment and ringing the doorbell, texting her asking to not call the police and 
knocking on the door. Officers Whitmore and J. Flores arrived on scene first, contacted an adult male who 
appeared heavily intoxicated at the porch of the target residence. The male was non-compliant, pounding on 
the front door while asking the victim to open up.  The male refused to get onto the ground and reached 
inside his pockets.  Officer Whitmore requested additional officers.  
Officer C. Lane arrived on scene and noticed the male suspect laying on his stomach on the porch of the 
apartment.  The suspect continued to refuse instructions to crawl away from the door.  Officer Lane was 
unsure if the suspect possessed any weapons as he had not been searched and did not have a full view of the 
porch to determine if the suspect could retrieve an item and use it as a weapon.  Officer Lane stated he was 
unable to effect an arrest from the position they were in. 
Per Officer Lane, in order to gain control of the suspect, take him into custody and prevent his escape, he 
grabbed ahold of his left arm and pulled him away from the porch as he laid on the ground.  During the 
pulling movement, the suspect's head struck the wood siding of the porch wall resulting in an approximate 
two inch laceration to his right eyebrow.  The suspect was taken into custody.  
AMR and Salinas Fire were summoned to the scene and provided aid to the suspect.  The suspect was highly 
intoxicated, could not sit up without assistance and mumbling incoherent words.  A statement was 
unattainable.  The suspect was transported to NMC by AMR for medical treatment where he received 7-8 
stitches.  He was medically cleared and booked into jail for felony domestic battery and 
resisting/delaying/obstructing law enforcement.
Based on the available information, this use of force appears to be objectively reasonable and within policy.

Narrative
Narrative
During this use of force investigation, I reviewed body-worn-camera videos, and in-dash vehicle
videos, interviewed officers, interviewed the suspect, interviewed a witness, and read the Salinas
Police reports documenting the incident.
 
On 10/20/2023 at approximately 1425 hours, California Highway Patrol requested a K9 officer to
assist with a suspect, Ruben Ayon Jr., who was wanted on an assault with a deadly weapon on
an officer. California Highway Patrol officers were pursuing Ayon who was actively fleeing in his
vehicle and making his way towards the city of Salinas on Davis Road. I informed K9 Officer
Anthony Garcia who had just arrived at the station for a second watch briefing of the request.
Officer Anthony Garcia left the station and Sergeant Roman advised he would be Officer
Garcia’s cover officer. Officer Anthony Garcia headed towards the pursuit as it was coming into
the city and at West Alisal and Church Street, the California Highway Patrol turned over the
pursuit to Salinas Police.
 
Officer Anthony Garcia assumed the primary vehicle as he pursued Ayon and Sergeant Roman
assumed the secondary pursuing unit. Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to conduct a Pursuit
Intervention Technique (PIT) numerous times as he pursued Ayon. Officer Anthony Garcia
attempted to conduct the PIT to stop Ayon and prevent any danger to the public. Each time
Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to PIT Ayon, Ayon would brake or maneuver his vehicle side
to side to avoid a successful PIT by Officer Anthony Garcia. The pursuit was approximately 1.38
miles long and went throughout the southside of Salinas until a successful PIT was initiated by
Sergeant Roman in the area of Alameda Avenue and East Romie Lane.
 
Sergeant Roman took over as the primary pursuing vehicle in the area of Alameda Avenue just
north of East Romie Lane after Officer Anthony Garcia was unsuccessful in conducting a PIT on
Ayon’s vehicle. Sergeant Roman was able to conduct a successful PIT on Ayon’s vehicle as they
were heading south on Alameda Avenue approaching East Romie Lane. The PIT caused Ayon’s
vehicle to head into the driveway of 
 East Romie Lane. Ayon then reversed his vehicle to
flee, however Sergeant Roman was able to block his exit with his patrol vehicle. Ayon then
struck the patrol vehicle and drove forward back into the driveway of 
 East Romie Lane. As
Ayon pulled into the driveway, Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to pin Ayon’s rear passenger
quarter panel with his patrol vehicle’s push bumper to prevent Ayon from fleeing. Ayon again
reversed out of the driveway and Sergeant Roman drove his patrol vehicle forward, making
contact with the rear-end of Ayon’s vehicle, to prevent him from fleeing.
 
Officer Anthony Garcia started to yell out verbal commands to Ayon to get on the ground and
turn off the vehicle. Sergeant Roman exited his patrol vehicle and gave Ayon verbal commands
to stop. Sergeant Roman pointed his department-issued firearm at Ayon while giving him
commands. Ayon refused to follow commands and he accelerated forward and was now further
into the driveway. Sergeant Roman then got back into the patrol vehicle and drove the patrol
vehicle to pin the patrol vehicle against Ayon’s vehicle. As Sergeant Roman was getting in his
patrol vehicle and sitting in the driver's seat, Ayon reversed at a fast rate and rammed into

Sergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle. Sergeant Roman’s driver door was still open when the
ramming occurred. Sergeant Roman then accelerated his patrol vehicle and pushed Ayon’s
vehicle into the driveway and up on a wooden fence and lemon tree that was situated to the right
of the driveway. A parked vehicle in the neighboring residence was in the driveway next to the
fence and lemon tree, it appeared the fence and lemon tree rested on the vehicle parked in the
neighboring driveway. This caused Ayon’s front end to be suspended up against the fence and
tree.
 
Several commands were given to Ayon to place his hands up and Ayon disobeyed commands
and continued to reach around inside the vehicle. Ayon also repositioned the vehicle's mirrors to
get a visual of Sergeant Roman who was situated behind him near the patrol vehicle. Ayon
refused commands for approximately 3 minutes and continued to reach around inside the
vehicle. Officer Munoz arrived on scene and deployed the 40mm less-than-lethal kinetic
projectile launcher and deployed (4) foam baton rounds to break out the windows of Ayon’s
vehicle. Officer Anthony Garcia then deployed K9 Bolt into the rear passenger windows to assist
with the apprehension of Ayon. K9 Bolt was able to assist with apprehending Ayon and officers
immediately approached the vehicle to assist with taking Ayon into custody and releasing K9
Bolt from him. Ayon suffered several K9 bite injuries to his upper right arm which required 35
staples and 2 sutures.
 
During my interview with Ayon at Natividad Medical Center, Ayon advised he knew officers were
pursuing him and he panicked. Ayon stated he complied with placing his hands up when the
officers shot the window out. Ayon complained of pain in his neck, and he believed it was from
the collision. Ayon agreed if he could do it all over again, he would have pulled over right away
and listened to the officer's commands. Ayon admitted to fleeing from the other pursuing agency
before Salinas Police got involved. Witness 
 provided videos to me as 
 across
the street from where the pursuit was terminated. 
 advised he could hear officers give
commands to the suspect several times during the incident.
 
Ayon presented life-threatening resistance by fleeing after committing an assault with a deadly
weapon on an officer and continued to flee without due regard for the public as officers pursued
him. Ayon also rammed Sergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle while he was seated inside it. Officers
attempted to de-escalate the situation by attempting to conduct PIT(s) numerous times. Officers
also attempted to de-escalate the situation after Ayon rammed Sergeant Roman’s vehicle with
Sergeant Roman sitting inside by using verbal commands to gain compliance. Ayon presented
active resistance by hiding his hands while inside the vehicle as officers commanded him to
place his hands up and stop reaching around the vehicle. The threats officers faced from Ayon
were his actions with his vehicle, the prior assault on the officer that led to the pursuit, and the
repositioning of his mirror in an attempt to get a visual of Sergeant Roman who was behind him.
Officers used intermediate force by deploying K9 Bolt into the vehicle after several minutes of
verbal commands while attempting to gain compliance by placing his hands up.
 
Based on the totality of the circumstances it is my opinion, that Sergeant Roman, Officer
Anthony Garcia, and Officer Jeff Munoz used reasonable force during this incident and was
within Salinas Police Policy.

Incident Summary

SYNOPSIS

On 9/23/23, at approximately 0223 hours, EGPD dispatch received a call from
Eunice APPLING claiming that an unknown subject was banging on her door at

EE. APPLING then told dispatch that the suspect kicked in her

door. APPLING repeatedly claimed she did not know who the person was.
Multiple EGPD officers responded.

Officer Carlos Rodriguez was first to arrive on scene at approximately 0228
hours. Officer Rodriguez staged one residence south and waited for backup
officers to arrive. Officer Rodriguez then heard a female screaming from within
the house. Given the circumstances, Officer Rodriguez felt that the female may

be in danger and entered the residence.

Officer Rodriguez entered and announced “Elk Grove PD” twice. The front door

barca Way

TALOLVaps

of the residence had signs of forced entry. He entered a hallway and saw a 
male, later identified as Leroy DANIELS, in a bedroom with APPLING. Officer 
Rodriguez ordered DANIELS to put his hands up twice at gunpoint. DANIELS 
did not comply and left his arms at his sides. 
DANIELS was wearing a black shirt and black pants that could easily conceal 
weapons. At this point in the investigation, he was believed to be a suspect in 
burglary or home invasion. Officer Rodriguez ordered both APPLING and 
DANIELS to put their hands up again and they complied. Officer Rodriguez 
ordered APPLING and DANIELS to come toward him three times. DANIELS 
refused and asked, 
 
 
what?  
while APPLING said 
 
 
DANIELS continued to be verbally non-compliant with Officer Rodriguez and told 
Officer Rodriguez to shoot him. Officer Rodriguez repeatedly told APPLING to 
move out of the way and she refused to do so. 
Officer Crain arrived on scene. Officer Rodriguez was able to get APPLING to 
move to Officer Crain in the hallway. DANIELS put his hands down by his sides 
again. Officer Rodriguez told DANIELS 
 
 
hands up bro, turn around.  
DANIELS refused and approached Officer Rodriguez rapidly while yelling at him 
about officers coming into his house. 
As he reached Officer Rodriguez, DANIELS stopped and put his hands behind 
his back. Officer Rodriguez guided DANIELS to face the wall and leaned him 
against it. Officer Rodriguez then grabbed DANIELS  
wrists behind his back to 
control him. 
DANIELS then turned toward Officer Rodriguez. Officer Rodriguez tried to 
control DANIELS and turn him around to be handcuffed. Officer Crain moved to 
assist him. DANIELS continued to resist both officers and struck Officer Crain in 
the face with a closed left fist. DANIELS then continued to repeatedly try to 
punch officers with closed fists. 
Given that DANIELS was believed to be a felony suspect who had also assaulted 
an officer, and who had not been searched for weapons, Officer Rodriguez 
determined it was necessary to use force to overcome DANIELS  
resistance. 
Officer Rodriguez struck DANIELS in the face with a closed right fist. It was 
ineffective and DANIELS continued to resist officers. 
Officer Crain was able to take DANIELS to the ground. Once on the ground, 
DANIELS rolled to his left side and was facing toward Officer Rodriguez. 
DANIELS said, 
 
 
are you hitting me man?  

Officer Crain attempted to roll DANIELS onto his stomach, but he resisted. 
DANIELS continued to try to escape the control of officers. DANIELS had not 
been searched. His arms were unrestrained, he was facing Officer Rodriguez, 
and had already shown the propensity to strike officers. Officer Rodriguez struck 
DANIELS in the face with his right elbow. DANIELS then turned his head to the 
ground. He stopped actively resisting, but still did not put his hands behind his 
back. Officer Rodriguez told DANIELS to put his hands behind his back eight (8) 
times total and warned DANIELS he would strike him again four (4) times total. 
DANIELS then put his hands behind his back without any further strikes. 
Officer Colby Hanna and John Taylor arrived on scene. Both kept control of 
DANIELS  
legs while Officer Rodriguez handcuffed DANIELS. 
DANIELS repeatedly claimed he could not breath, even though officers were not 
on his upper back area. DANIELS also screaming he was struck in the eye. 
Officer Rodriguez sat DANIELS up and requested medical aid for him. DANIELS 
was moved to a patrol car. CSD Fire responded and treated DANIELS. He was 
later transported to Kaiser Medical Center by Officer Hanna. 
Through investigation, it was learned that APPLING and DANIELS were in a 
relationship and in an argument where APPLING locked DANIELS out. 
APPLING admitted to lying when asked if she knew who was trying to enter her 
home because she believed it would get officers to her house faster. APPLING 
was cited and released for 148.5(c) PC. 
It was later discovered that DANIELS had an orbital fracture of the right eye area.

OFFICER INJURIES 
Officer Crain complained of pain to the right side of his face due to being struck 
by DANIELS. He was medically treated at Methodist Hospital. Officer Crain 
completed the workers  compensation information with Sergeant Welshons. 
CITIZEN INJURIES 
- 
DANIELS had swelling around his right eye and a bloody nose. He was 
ultimately diagnosed with a fractured orbital and cleared for incarceration. 
ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVIEW 
I contacted DANIELS in the Emergency Room of Kaiser Hospital. DANIELS 
refused to speak to me regarding the incident.

WITNESS STATEMENTS 
I obtained a witness statement from APPLING. It should be noted, APPLING  
account of the incident differs from the body camera footage. Specifically, 
regarding the fact that APPLING claimed officers immediately began striking her 
husband unprovoked. The following is a summary of her statement. 
The officers shouldn  have done it. He was pointing his gun, then he put his gun 
down and socked DANIELS for no reason. I told 911 someone was breaking in, 
that was just so you guys could come mediate. The officers came in and just 
wanted to get DANIELS. They told me to move, and I told them it was okay. I 
can control him, you officers can  
I was trying to tell officers that, and they told 
me 
 
 
move.  When he said move, he hit DANIELS instantly. DANIELS was 
 
 
back and they threw him on the ground and the other officer kept hitting 
him. I grabbed the officer to get him off. The officer said he would tase me. You 
can tase me, but you guys are doing illegal things. He didn  
fight you guys. 
When he was on the ground he was tussling, but you guys had already hit him. 
(I asked APPLING to clarify what she meant by 
 
 
The officer hit him first, I  
not going to sit here and lie. If he hit the officer first, I 
would say that. The officer immediately socked him, and the other officer 
grabbed him, so he was like 
 
 
(APPLING demonstrated shrugging and waving 
her arms as if trying to physically resist the officer  physical control). That  
tussling to me. 
(I asked, 
 
 
struggling for control?  
Yes. I grabbed the other officer; I pulled him back because that  
illegal. When I 
said, 
 
 
okay,  that means there  
no harm to anyone. I kept telling the officers I 
was fine. That  
cool that they need to investigate. They could have listened. 
They came in guns pointed. You cannot come in my house like that, they should 
have knocked first. I told the dispatcher it was my husband. 
This statement was recorded on my Body Worn Camera:

NARRATIVE

 

On Sunday, 12-10-23, | (Deputy Acuna #118) was working patrol in Lassen County. | was wearing a full
department uniform and was operating a fully marked patrol unit. At approximately 1106 hours, | was
dispatched to PY for a report of a verbal fight between family members. Dispatch stated the
reporting party, David Arthur Garfield, reported his son, David Dean Garfield, was threatening him and his wife.
David Arthur stated David Dean was currently outside their trailer, throwing unknown objects at it.

David Arthur stated this incident began because he unhooked David Dean’s trailer from the property power
supply. David Arthur stated David Dean lives on the same property but does not pay bills. David Arthur stated
David Dean has not been sleeping the past few nights and is acting erratic. David Arthur stated David Dean was
currently armed with a baseball bat, but had access to a “sawed off shotgun” in his trailer. David Arthur advised
me that prior to him entering his trailer to shelter himself from David Dean, David Dean “came at him"" (David
Arthur) with the bat. David Arthur explained that David Dean came within 10 feet of him with the bat. David
Arthur stated he was afraid at that moment and thought David Dean was going to harm him with the bat. David
Arthur stated David Dean was wearing a white shirt and a black baseball hat.

While speaking with David Arthur on the phone, | heard David Arthur say something to the affect of, you broke
my fucking window. David Arthur stated he’s had enough and would be loading his pistol to defend himself.
David Arthur stated he would not be responsible to whatever happens to his son. When asked what he meant by
that, David Arthur stated he would shoot his son in self defense if he had to. | advised David Arthur to use sound
judgment and again advised him | was currently in route. | elected to terminate the phone conversation at that
time. This is because of the new developing details | just heard and | believed a Code-3 response was necessary.

| contacted Sgt. Loflin (#110) and updated him on the situation. He agreed a Code-3 response was appropriate.

While in route, Deputy Kennemore (#121) and Deputy M. Lee (#113) advised they were at Milford Grade (OHV
Patrol) and would meet us at Doyle Grade and US 3955S. Dispatch advised us that a CHP Unit would meet us at
that location as well.

While in route, Dispatch received several 911 calls from surrounding neighbors. The calls are summarized as
follows:

One caller stated there was a male outside of the residence, acting erratic, and was armed with a shotgun. A
separate caller stated they witnessed the subject (David Dean) chasing his brother down the driveway, while
being armed with a shotgun. Another caller stated they heard several gunshots coming from the residence. As |
arrived on scene, another call came in stating an unknown individual was leaving the residence on foot. The
caller stated the subject that left was wearing black clothing and was carrying a red unknown item in their hand.
End of additional call summaries.

| met with all other responding units and a plan was decided on. Myself, Deputy Kennemore and CHP Office
Bruce would be utilizing deadly force options (Patrol Rifles). Sgt. Loflin and Deputy M. Lee would be utilizing non-
lethal options (non-lethal shotgun and 40mm launcher). A perimeter would be set and we would call out David
Dean using a patrol vehicle’s PA system.

NARRATIVE

 

We proceeded to respond to the residence. While in route, we contacted a female matching the description of
the individual that left the residence on foot. That individual was identified as David Dean’s mother, Donna
Garfield. The red item Donna had was a sweatshirt. Donna stated she had to run away from her residence
because David Dean was threatening them (David Arthur and herself) with a shotgun. Donna stated while she
was running, she heard two shotgun shots being fired. Donna believed David Dean was firing at her and David
Arthur. Donna stated her husband and son were still at the residence and her son was currently armed with a
shotgun. Donna was approximately 500 yards from her property and arrived at her current location by running
through an undeveloped field. | advised Donna to walk further down Doyle Grade and a Deputy would contact
her when the scene is made safe.

We proceeded to the property where | contacted a male (later identified as David Arthur) who was just north of
the property. David Arthur stated he had to run way from David Dean and stated David Dean took “two shots at
me.” David Arthur stated David Dean was still on scene and was possibly in his (David Dean’s) trailer. | advised
David Arthur to leave the immediate area and a Deputy would recontact him.

As we positioned our vehicles, | could hear loud music coming from David Dean’s trailer. Once there was a break
in the music, Deputy M. Lee began to call out David Dean via PA system. Deputy M. Lee and Deputy Kennemore
are part of the LCSO Hostage Negotiator Team. They handled the following communication with David Dean.

David Dean exited the trailer and had a cellphone is his right hand and a Corona beer bottle in his left hand.
David Dean matched the description provided by David Arthur. David Dean continuously spoke about his
displeasure with the LCSO due to a lack of response regarding prior threats made to his son, et is
important to note that David Dean did not contact the LCSO regarding these alleged threats, but rather contacted
a third party in hopes the message would be relayed to the LCSO. David Dean was extremely agitated and
continuously disregarded orders to exit the property and speak with us. David Dean was on the other side of a
locked metal gate that was approximately 30 yards from our location. David Dean spoke with LCSO HNT from
approximately 1150 hours until approximately 1530 hours. During that time frame, LCSO HNT utilized patrol
vehicle’s PA system and was also able to establish communication via cellphone. David Dean continuously
refused to comply with orders. At one-point David Dean entered his trailer and exited his trailer with more
Corona beer. David Dean was also on the phone with his son Bens demanded be brought to the
scene so he could say bye to him. Due to the nature of the call, it was decided ould not be brought to
the scene. David Dean also stated he would fight law enforcement and would not be taken to jail. At one point,
David Dean asked the officers on scene to drop their weapons and fight him.

   
  

LCSO SWAT was activated and arrived on scene. | was relieved from my position and | proceeded to act as a
Drone Visual Observer for Deputy Falchetta who utilized LCSO Drone #1. LCSO Drone #1 was utilized as
overwatch for SWAT. SWAT developed a plane to take David Dean into custody. See Sgt. Loflin’s Report for further
details regarding the apprehension of David Dean and statements from Donna and David Arthur Garfield.

After David Dean was taken into custody, SEMSA Medic 5 arrived on scene and checked on David Dean. SEMSA
Medic 5 treated David for a wound to his right-hand index finger and right triceps. David Dean was placed in my

patrol vehicle while | photographed the scene.

| walked to the scene and took several photographs of the entire scene with my body worn camera (BWC). The
trailer door was open and | took photographs as | was entering the trailer. To the immediate left of the front
door, inside the trailer, was a wooden baseball bat. | took photographs of the bat in its original location. | later
seized the bat and booked it into an LCSO evidence locker. On the couch inside the trailer was a shotgun. The
shotgun barrel was removed from the stock. The barrel appeared to have been painted with a rhino lining type
paint that was black in color. The stock of the shotgun had a side saddle that contained 5 live 12-gauge
Winchester Super X bird-shot shells. Deputy Meier (#126) advised me that when he rendered the shotgun safe, a
single expended shotgun shell ejected from the chamber. That expended shell was in the same location of the
shotgun. | photographed the aforementioned items in place with my BWC. | later collected the items and they
were booked into an LCSO evidence locker.

| proceeded to photograph the rest of the trailer and search for any additional firearms and ammo. In the master
bedroom, left of the bed was a cabinet. Inside the cabinet, | located an open box of 12-gauge Winchester Super X
Birdshot. Inside the box was 15 live shotgun shells. | photographed the box in place and seized it as evidence.
The box was later booked into an LCSO evidence locker. | took additional photographs of the trailer. All my BWC
footage was later uploaded to Visual Labs.

Due to the statements provided by Donna and David Arthur, coupled with the statements provided by the
additional 911 calls and the evidence seized on scene, | placed David Dean under arrest for the following charges:

2 counts of PC 245 (a) (2) (assault with deadly weapon, firearm), 1 count of 245 (a) (1) (assault with deadly
weapon, non-firearm), PC 594 (a) (2) (felony vandalism), 2 counts of PC 422(a) (terrorist threats), 2 counts of PC
368 (b) (1) (elder abuse), PC 69 (threat of violence to peace officer), and PC 417 (c) (brandish firearm to peace
officer).

| proceeded to transport David Dean to Banner Lassen Medical Center to be medically cleared to be booked into
custody.

At BLMC, David Dean was treated for his injured (possibly broken) ring finger. While waiting for David Dean’s
treatment, | elected to obtain David Dean’s statement. | activated my BWC and read David Dean his Miranda
Rights verbatim from a prepared Miranda warning card. David Dean stated he understood and wanted to provide
his statement. David Dean provided the following in summary:

David Dean stated the entire incident started due to the prior threats made to his son. David Dean stated he has
not been able to sleep because he was worried about his son’s well-being. David stated he was worried about
the location of his trailer and requested his father move the trailer. David Dean stated his father did not help,
which angered him. David Dean stated this morning, his trailer was disconnected from power. David Dean stated
he did not know who unplugged the trailer. David Dean exited his trailer with the baseball bat to confront the
individual. David Dean stated he realized it was his father who disconnected the power and a verbal altercation
took place. David Dean stated he was wielding the bat at that time but he never threatened his father with the

bat. David admitted to having a heated argument with his father and mother but was adamant that no threats
were made. David Dean stated his parents entered their trailer while he was still outside. David Dean admitted to
throwing rocks at their trailer but was unsure if damage was done. David Dean stated if damage was done, he
would pay for the repairs. David stated while throwing rocks, he accidentally broke the passenger side window of
his father’s suburban. David stated he witnessed his mother leave the property on foot. David Dean admitted to
yelling at his mother while she was leaving but again, stated he never threatened her. David Dean stated he was
unaware his father left the property and believed he was still on scene during the entire incident. David Dean
stated he did not possess the shotgun during the incident. End of original statement.

| advised David Dean that we received several additional 911 calls stating he was witnessed being in possession
of a shotgun, chasing a subject off of the property and shotgun blast being heard. David Dean changed his
statement and said he was in possession of a shotgun, but his parents never saw him holding the firearm. David
Dean strongly denied the allegation’s of him firing the shotgun. | asked David Dean if his mother or father have a
shotgun. David Dean stated they did not. | advised David Dean that Sgt. Loflin informed me of several live
shotgun shells being located around his parents trailer. | also advised David Dean that a shotgun wad was located
inside his father’s suburban. David Dean stated that was a lie. | advised David Dean | was not lying to him and he
again stated that was not possible. | advised David Dean that a expended shotgun shell was ejected from the
shotgun when being made safe. David Dean again stated that was not true, and that there should have been 1
live shell in the chamber and 5 live shells affixed to the shotgun (shotgun saddle). David Dean stated the last time
he fired the shotgun was when he fired a warning shot at an unknown individual on a different date. David Dean
stated that incident took place approximately 3 weeks ago. | advised David Dean that his parents both stated
they believed he fired the shotgun at them. David Dean again was adamant that he never fired the shotgun.
David Dean did again state he was in possession of the shotgun during a portion of the incident. David Dean
stated he has a camera on scene that would exonerate himself. David Dean stated the video footage would not
show anything (because it faces the road) but it would pick up any sounds (i.e. shotgun blast). | advised David
Dean | would provided him a consent to search form and view the footage. David Dean stated that he would be
willing to provide consent to search his cellphone for the video footage. End of summary.

| was relieved at BLMC by Deputy Leighton (#130). Deputy Falchetta later transported David Dean to the Lassen
County Jail where he was booked for the aforementioned charges.

All my BWC footage was later uploaded to Visual Labs.

Case status: David Dean placed under arrest for aforementioned charges. Follow- up needed: contact additional
reporting parties for their statements. Obtain video footage from David Dean’s cellphone.

trailer and walked to a gate near the driveway. David was unarmed but highly agitated. David was holding a
cellphone in one hand and a bottle of alcohol in the other hand. David refused to exit the gate and come
towards us as instructed. David was yelling at us to leave his property. David made several threats that he would
fight us should we come any closer. David stated that his parents were lying about the incident. In addition,
David stated that he did not like law enforcement because his son had recently been threatened by David
Guthrie at school.

Detective Lee and Deputy Kennemore, who are both certified crisis negotiators (CNT), began communicating
directly with David utilizing their public address system. During this time, David continued to make threats
towards us. David was pacing near the gate and shouting obscenities. Several times during our negotiations,
David started walking back to his trailer. It had been reported that David's shotgun was located inside his trailer.
At one point, David stated that he would retrieve his gun from the trailer for us to inspect. David was told not to
retrieve the firearm, or return to the trailer. David made several statements that he had not fired the shotgun,
other than a warning shot. David continued to state that his parents are liars and he wanted to see his son. At
one point, David's son, Brody Garfield, arrived in a beige sedan. | instructed Brody to return to the vehicle. |
informed the adult driver of the vehicle to take Brody away from the residence, to which he agreed. Afterwards,
CHP closed Doyle Grade to traffic by having Doyle Fire block the intersection of Doyle Grade and US 395.

Deputy Kennemore and Detective Lee continued negotiating with David for more than two hours. During this
time, communications with David would break down and he would walk away or stop talking to us. Several
methods of communication were utilized. This included the use of a PA system, phone calls directly to David,
and direct verbal communication. However, David refused to comply with our commands.

Based on the nature of the call, David's level of agitation, and his refusal to surrender; | requested the Lassen
County Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team be deployed. In addition, | requested Deputy Falchetta #115
respond with an aerial drone.

SWAT TEAM DEPLOYMENT AND ARREST:

At approximately 1427 hours, SWAT arrived on scene. David was commanded to exit the property unarmed with
his hands in the air. David refused to comply with our lawful orders. CNT with David continued. David continued
to make threats towards us.

At approximately 1445 hours, two three-man arrest teams converged on David. Several commands were given
to David to get on the ground and surrender. David began to run away from us and towards his trailer. Asa
result, K9 Hank was deployed to apprehend David. It should be mentioned; David's trailer door was opened and
his shotgun was reported to be inside the trailer. Due to the fact that David was running towards his trailer with
access to weapons, | utilized my department issued less lethal 40 mm launcher. | fired one less lethal direct
impact round at David. The munition failed to strike David. The round struck a vehicle behind him, causing
damage to the front passenger headlight. David retreated to his trailer and grabbed a sawed off shotgun.

Deputy Meier #126 informed units that David was at the front door, inside the trailer, holding a firearm. Based
on the fact that David was armed with a firearm, barricaded inside his trailer, failed to submit to commands, and
posed an immediate danger; | positioned myself in line with David's front door with my less lethal 40 mm
launcher. At one point, | observed David standing near the door yelling at us. | could not see David's left arm.

launcher. The round struck David's right hand and he retreated further inside the trailer. SWAT deployed three
CS aerosol gas canisters inside the trailer. In addition, several mussel blast flash bangs (diversionary devises)
rounds were fired. However, David refused to exit the trailer.

SUPPLEMENT 2 - Canine Deployment

 

On Sunday, December 10, 2023, | (Deputy A. Meier #126) was called out with the Lassen County Sheriff's Office
Special Weapons and Tactics Team to assist Deputies with an armed non-compliant subject (David Dean
Garfield). David made statements of fighting law enforcement and was reported to have fired a shotgun at his
father.

| deployed Canine Hank with the SWAT Team. Sergeant Russell, Deputy Lee, myself, and Canine Hank
approached the property and David through a creek bed. David continued to disobey lawful commands to be
taken into custody. Sergeant Russell, Deputy Lee, Myself, and Canine Hank emerged from the creek bed and
approached David. We identified ourselves and gave David verbal orders to get on the ground and show us his
hands. David did not comply with our orders and began running toward the open door of a camping trailer.

| gave Canine Hank a command to bite and released him toward David. There was a car between Canine Hank
and David. David entered the trailer and Canine Hank went to the left. | directed Canine Hank into the camp
trailer giving more bite commands. Canine Hank entered the trailer crashing into the cabinets. Canine Hank
exited the trailer and came back to me.

David came to the open doorway of the trailer and | gave Canine Hank an additional bite command. Canine
Hank entered the trailer and then came back out.

David left my sight and reappeared in the doorway. David held a shotgun in his right hand with the barrel
pointing to the ground. | took cover behind the car and pointed my department issued Glock 17 pistol at David. |
secured Canine Hank and ordered David to drop the gun and show me his hands.

David left my sight, stepping deeper into the trailer. | ordered David to come out and to show me his hands.
David looked through the doorway at me, keeping his body hidden. David showed me both his hands by flipping
me off with his middle fingers. | saw a small dark object in David's hand while he flipped me off. The item was
later identified as an electronic smoking device.

| continued to point my firearm at David while giving hims orders to come out of the trailer with his hands up.
David continued to disobey my orders. The Lassen County Sheriff Armored Rescue Vehicle (ARV) was driven
close to the trailer, allowing me to get better cover.

| secured Canine Hank in my patrol car and returned to the ARV.

When David came out of the trailer with his hands up, he was taken into custody. Sergeant Merritt, Deputy
Lawton, and I checked the trailer for other persons. Sitting on the couch where David was standing was a single
shot break action 12 gauge shotgun.

| used my BWC Recording to show the shotgun in the condition it was located. | rendered the shotgun safe. An
expended 12 gauge shell was ejected from the chamber of the shotgun. | used my BWC to record the shotgun
rendered safe and left in place to later be collected.

On Sunday 12/10/2023 at about 1155 hours, | (Sgt. D. Russell #107) was notified the SWAT Team was being called
out for a barricaded subject. | was off duty and | am a SWAT Team member. | responded to the Sheriff's Office.

| was notified the suspect (David Garfield Jr) had been drinking alcohol. David Jr was reported to have chased his
mom with a baseball bat while threatening her. David Jr was also reported to have chased his mom and his dad
with a sawed-off shotgun and discharged the shotgun as his mom and dad fled. It was not clear if David Jr shot
at his parents or not.

Crisis negotiators were on scene and had established communication with David Jr. It was being relayed that
negotiations were good, then bad and unstable. David was continuing to drink alcohol, while units were on
scene.

The SWAT Team deployed from the Sheriff's Office with the Armored Rescue Vehicle (ARV). We staged less than
1-mile away from the scene. We were informed negotiations were going good at the time and we stood by. A
short time later, Sgt. M. Loflin #110 advised negotiations were breaking down and the suspect was getting more
agitated.

The SWAT Team moved into the property and parked in the driveway near Doyle Grade. David Jr was standing
behind a locked gate to the property and yelling obscenities. Negotiations continued as we stood by. David Jr
was continuing to drink alcohol. David Jr had previously told the negotiators, he would fight law enforcement.
David Jr told negotiators his shotgun was in his trailer, which is a bumper-pull travel trailer. The travel trailer was
behind (north) David as he was talking to the units on scene. Negotiations had continued for approximately 3-
hours at this point. It was apparent rationalizing with David Jr to surrender was unlikely.

While negotiations continued, Deputy A. Meier #126 with K9 Hank, Deputy D. Lee #125 and | made our way to a
drainage east of the property David Jr was on. | was equipped with a 12 gauge less-lethal shotgun, loaded with
beanbag rounds. We made our way through the drainage and stayed undetected by David Jr. David Jr's travel
trailer door was open and this is where David said his shotgun was located. We made our way out of the
drainage in line with the travel trailer. We were moving in to cut David off from getting back to his trailer where
the shotgun was located.

As we were trying to get into position behind David, he noticed us and began running toward his open trailer
door. | identified us and gave David Jr warnings, specifically, ""Sheriff's Office, get on the ground, you're going to
get shot, get on the ground, Sheriff's Office."" David Jr quickly made his way to the trailer and was nearing the
door. David Jr was un-searched and | did not know if David Jr was armed. David Jr had already told negotiators
his shotgun was inside of his trailer. David Jr had already told negotiators he would fight law enforcement. |
feared David was going to enter his trailer to arm himself with a shotgun. Furthermore, we were in a position
with no cover to shield ourselves from gunfire. Based on the totality of the circumstances, | deployed one
beanbag round at David Jr's mid-section in attempt to keep him from going into the trailer. It appeared David Jr
was impacted and he stumbled outside the door of the trailer, but he continued into the trailer. | deployed a
second beanbag round as he was in the doorway. | am unsure if David Jr was impacted by that round.

Now that David had entered his trailer and was out of sight, | yelled that we were compromised and to seek
cover. | ran to a shed south of the trailer to get cover. Deputy Meier was pinned down behind a car directly
outside the trailer door. Deputy Meier broadcasted that David Jr was now armed with a shotgun inside the

trailer.

We moved our ARV between Deputy Meier and the trailer. Assistant Team Leader S. Lawton #116 fired 12 gauge
muzzle-blast diversionary rounds at the trailer door as Team member S. Rojas #214 deployed CS aerosol canisters
into the trailer. Crisis Negotiator, Detective M. Lee #113 came up and got in the ARV and continued negotiations
with David Jr. David Jr was refusing to come outside.

After approximately 16 more minutes of negotiating, David Jr continued to refuse to exit the trailer. Assistant
Team Leader Lawton fired 12 gauge muzzle-blast diversionary rounds at the trailer door as Team member S.
Rojas deployed CS aerosol canisters into the trailer.

Detective Lee continued negotiating with David Jr. David Jr asked Detective Lee for five more minutes. When
asked why, David Jr said he was praying and smoking (marijuana). Detective Lee continued talking with David Jr
and told him she would give him five minutes. Detective Lee set a timer for five minutes. Detective Lee
continued negotiations. After approximately six-minutes, Detective Lee told David Jr his five minutes was up and
asked him to come out. David Jr was yelling and not coming out.

David Jr asked for one more minute. After 1-minute, Detective Lee told David Jr it had been 1-minute and to
come out. David Jr did was not coming out. Detective Lee continued negotiations with Dave Jr. 11-minutes had
past since David Jr asked for five more minutes.

David Jr asked for another 30-seconds. After 30-seconds had passed Detective Lee told David Jr it had been
thirty-seconds. David Jr walked out of the trailer with his hands up. David Jr was handcuffed, searched and sat
down ona picnic table. Medical was already staged down the road and was asked to proceed to the scene.
David Jr was walked to the road an treated by medical.

Pyorre's Criminal History
NarraƟve:
On Thursday, November 17, 2023, I was assigned as a DetecƟve, in the Major Crimes Unit, with the Lake County
Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce. I was at the Lake County Sheriﬀ's Main Oﬃce when I heard Sergeant Ben Moore and Deputy
Nakahara get dispatched to
Dixon Drive in Lakeport, for a reported assault with a knife. At the Ɵme it was
unknown if there were any injuries and Central Dispatch did not have any further informaƟon.
I looked at the incident on my computer and saw a typed comment made by dispatch about a “Male made a
comment if anyone shows up at the house, he would kill them. Male was pushing kids, was a knife involved Unk
if Resp sƟll has it.” I saw a comment typed by dispatch about Deputy Nakahara staƟng there was a history of the
responsible in the trailer on the property with a ﬁrearm. I saw another typed comment about Sergeant Moore
staƟng the responsible had barricaded the driveway. I knew there was limited staﬃng and responded to assist.
The responsible was later idenƟﬁed as Richard Pyorre.
At approximately 1355 hours, I responded to
Dixon Drive. On my way, I heard Sergeant Andrew Welter from
the Lakeport Police Department advise over the radio the responsible had a ﬁrearm, shots were ﬁred, and the
responsible was in the backyard, and in the swimming pool.
At approximately 1400 hours, I arrived and saw Lakeport Police Chief Brad Rasmussen and Lieutenant Dale Stobe
standing outside the property of
Dixon Drive. Sergeant Moore knew I had arrived on the scene and
requested I move to the right front corner of the residence with my less lethal department-issued Remington
870 less lethal shotgun. I saw Deputy Nakahara standing at the front right corner of the residence, holding his
ﬁrearm out in front of him, aiming it towards the back of the residence. I saw a wooden fence and an open
pedestrian gate leading to the pool. Deputy Nakahara appeared to be focused on that area. At this Ɵme, I did
not know who ﬁred shots and believed Richard was sƟll an acƟve threat.
I saw Sergeant Moore going towards the rear leŌ corner of the residence. Sergeant Moore turned around and
asked if the individuals standing in front of the property were law enforcement. I told Sergeant Moore they
were. Sergeant Moore asked for one of them to assist Deputy Nakahara, which Chief Rasmussen did.
I met with Captain Chwialkowski, Sergeants Moore, and Welter at the rear leŌ corner of the residence. Captain
Chwialkowski stated Richard was in the pool and he could see head movement. At about that Ɵme, DetecƟve
Newton arrived and met with us. DetecƟve Newton and Sergeant Welter remained at the back leŌ corner of the
residence while Captain Chwialkowski, Sergeant Moore, and I went back to the front right corner of the
residence. I asked Sergeant Moore if the main residence had been secured. Sergeant Moore stated it wasn’t.

Lieutenant Luke Bingham requested oﬃcers enter the main residence and secure it. As the residence is two
stories and posiƟoned above the pool, he asked for one of us to get eyes on Richard inside the pool and update
him. SheriﬀRob Howe, Captain Chwialkowski, and I entered the main residence, idenƟﬁed ourselves, and
secured the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Other depuƟes secured the second story of the residence. SheriﬀHowe, Captain
Chwialkowski, and I were able to see Richard inside the pool from a small wooden deck located in the back of the
residence. I could see Richard in the pool. Richard’s head/face area was sƟcking out of the water, and he was
not moving. I was unable to tell if Richard was deceased. Lieutenant Bingham requested I come back out to the
front of the residence.
Lieutenant Bingham had acquired a ballisƟc shield and gave it to me. Lieutenant Bingham made the decision
that we were going to move up to Richard in the pool. Lieutenant Bingham, other oﬃcers and I approached
Richard. As I approached Richard, I idenƟﬁed ourselves, and asked Richard to show us empty hands. I received
no response from Richard. As I got closer to the swimming pool, I saw Richard holding a black handgun in his
right hand. Richard was not moving, and it was apparent he was deceased.
Based on my training and experience, Richard was holding a black Glock handgun. Richard sƟll had a ﬁrm grip on
the handle of the handgun with his right hand. When Lieutenant Bingham and Deputy James Rhine removed
Richard from the pool, the handgun came out of Richard’s right hand. Lieutenant Bingham checked Richard’s
pulse but was unable to locate one.
At about this Ɵme, I began to secure the scene with crime scene tape due to the nature of the incident. The Lake
County District AƩorney's Oﬃce InvesƟgators were asked to respond.
AŌer securing the scene, Sergeant Joseph Dutra asked me to speak with Lakeport Fireﬁghter

Interview Transcript (
NarraƟve:
On 11/16/2023, at approximately 1340 hours, Central Dispatch advised an altercaƟon occurred at
Dixon
Drive in Lakeport, California, in the County of Lake. InformaƟon reported indicated a knife was involved and it
was unknown if the male subject sƟll had the knife. I heard Central Dispatch being advised by oﬃcers on the
scene a male subject had a ﬁrearm and was discharging the ﬁrearm at the oﬃcers.
I responded to the residence ""Code 3"". I arrived on scene at approximately 1400 hours. Upon arrival, I moved to
the west side of the residence where DetecƟve Castellanos, Sergeant Ben Moore, Captain Chris Chwialkowksi,
and Lakeport Police Department Sergeant Andrew Welter were located. I observed an individual ﬂoaƟng in the
pool on the north side of the residence.
I provided cover unƟl contact could be made with the individual in the pool and the individual was extracted
from the pool. The individual, later idenƟﬁed as Richard Pyorre (AKA Rick), was later determined to be deceased.
Upon observing the decedent, I saw he had a gun holster aﬃxed to the front of his pants. There was also a black
Glock style handgun and cell phone in the pool. There was also a knife on the ground next to the decedent’s right
side as he lay in a supine posiƟon on the ground.
The scene was secured and at approximately 1500 hours, I responded to the Lake County Sheriﬀ's Oﬃce, located
at 1220 MarƟn Street in Lakeport. I then authored Search Warrant 23-267 for the residence of
Dixon Drive
and the person of Richard Pyorre. The Honorable Andrew Blum later reviewed the search warrant and signed it
at approximately 1618 hours, thereby commanding a search of the property.
Upon my return to the scene, I conducted a canvass of the neighborhood at Sergeant Dutra’s request. The
following are the neighbors and locaƟons I contacted.

Property List - Item 1
NarraƟve:
On Thursday, November 16th, 2023 at approximately 1429 hours I was on duty with the Lake County Sheriﬀ’s
Oﬃce (LCSO) as Evidence Technician when I received a call from DetecƟve Nate Newton to respond to
Dixon
Drive for an oﬃcer involved shooƟng. I loaded my equipment into the crime scene van and drove to the scene,
arriving at approximately 1437 hours.
For ease of reading, placards will be noted with a P and the corresponding number.
Upon arrival, I was met by Lieutenant Luke Bingham, DetecƟve Sergeant Joe Dutra, DetecƟve Nate Newton,
DetecƟve Tony Castellanos, Deputy Mendelsohn, Deputy Rhine, Lake County District AƩorney (LCDA)
InvesƟgators, Chief Bruce Smith, ScoƩ Poma, Denise Hinchcliﬀ, and John Gregore, and personnel from Lakeport
Police and Lakeport Fire ProtecƟon District. I took iniƟal establishing photos of the locaƟon, and the license
plates of the vehicles blocking the driveway. I then met with DetecƟve Castellanos who walked me to the
decedent, later idenƟﬁed as Richard Michael Pyorre. I was informed Pyorre was pulled from the pool prior to my
arrival. Pyorre was lying next to the pool in a supine posiƟon with his arms outstretched over his head and his
bare feet poinƟng toward the pool. He was wearing camouﬂage cargo pants, blue swim trunks, blue jersey shirt,
black zip front sweatshirt, a brown leather belt with a holster, a dog collar, and necklace. Near his leŌ side was a
pair of sunglasses (P9), a blue ﬂashlight which was switched on (P8), and an empty gray zippered case (P8). On
his right side was a pocketknife (P7). In the pool was a black ﬁrearm (P10) and a cell phone (P11).
AŌer the search warrant was signed, I took photos within the crime scene tape, including the vehicles on the
property, spent cartridge cases (P6 and P12), an unspent shell cartridge (P5), a canister of pepper spray (P4),
several defects in the wooden fence and gate to the pool area, the area around the decedent, and the interior of
the camper. Both the ﬁrearm and the cell phone were retrieved from the pool. Deputy Rhine rendered the
ﬁrearm safe, removing the magazine and the round in the chamber. I took photos of this process. Using a sterile
boƩle and pipeƩe, I collected a sample of the pool water.
Sgt. Dutra phoned Dr. Bennet Omalu for a recommendaƟon on leaving the decedent in his wet clothing or
removing it. Dr. Omalu requested the removal of his clothing. During the removal of his clothing, Deputy Rhine
located another fully loaded magazine in his right cargo pocket and a pair of pliers and keys in his right rear
pocket which were leŌ at the residence. Deputy Rhine also located a small wound on the front of the decedent's
neck, and a small hard lump under the skin of his back, consistent in size and shape of a spent bullet, which I
photographed. The decedent was then placed in a black body bag, secured by Deputy Rhine with a zip Ɵe.
AŌer photographing all items in place, I collected the spent cartridge cases, pepper spray, unspent shell
cartridge, zippered case, ﬂashlight, sunglasses, pocketknife, cell phone, ﬁrearm, loaded magazines, unspent
cartridge from the ﬁrearm chamber, pool water sample, the decedent’s belt with holster, dog collar and

necklace, and gave the items to LCDA InvesƟgator Poma. I secured the wet clothing in the crime scene van to be
placed in the evidence dryer.
I then photographed the camper, which was parked in the driveway. The exterior passenger side of the camper
was surrounded with various items including life vests, chairs, plasƟc totes, tools, and other miscellaneous
objects. The door to the camper was open and the window was broken out. The steps into the camper were
covered with broken glass and the interior was cluƩered with various photos, papers, clothing, dishes and
cookware, sports and music equipment, and an air pistol. In a drawer of the sleeping area of the camper, LCDA
Chief InvesƟgator Smith located a handwriƩen note on a pad of yellow lined paper which said “I love you I’m
sorry Please Forgive me Thank you”.
At approximately 1800 hours, mortuary personnel Grant Smith and Brandon Frace arrived and removed the
decedent to Chapel of the Lakes.
I leŌ the scene at approximately 1753 hours. Upon arrival to LCSO Evidence, I placed the decedent’s clothing in
the evidence dryer and locked it. All photos were uploaded to disc (item 1) and all equipment was cleaned and
restocked for future use.

On 11/18/23, at approximately 0930 hours, DetecƟves Castellanos Newton and I responded back to
Dixon
Dr. in Lakeport. The family had contacted DetecƟve Castellanos and informed him that had located a suspected
pipe bomb.
Upon arrival, we located the device in the bar near the pool, hidden behind some boards. DetecƟve Newton
photographed the device and where it was located. I contacted Napa County Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce Sergeant Frank
Walsh, who is the commander of their bomb unit. I explained to him what the device looked like and where it
was located. UlƟmately the decision was made to relocate the device to a secure facility to be examined at a
later date.
On 11/20/23, at approximately 1100 hours, I met with Sergeant Frank Walsh, who examined the device. The
device was determined not to be an explosive and only contained a vape pen.
The pen and pipe were both photographs and disposed of in an approved manner. They had no evidenƟary
value and the family did not want them returned.

Property List - Item 2
NarraƟve:
On November 21st, 2023, at approximately 0700 hours, I arrived at Chapel of the Lakes Mortuary for the autopsy
of Richard Michael Pyorre. I met with Lake County Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce (LCSO) InvesƟgaƟons Sergeant Joe Dutra, Lake
County District AƩorney (LCDA) InvesƟgators ScoƩ Poma and Melissa Bedford, Forensic Pathologist Dr. BenneƩ
Omalu, and Pathology Assistants Alexandra DiƩorino and Stephanie Powers.
Before going to the mortuary, Dr. Omalu requested I bring the decedent’s clothing. I removed the clothing from
the evidence dryer, placed each item in a separate bag, and placed the liner paper into a manila envelope. Upon
closer examinaƟon, the black sweatshirt had a small defect on the front upper right side, near the seamline
between the hood, and the upper chest/neck area near the zipper. The blue jersey shirt did not have any visible
defects.
I provided Dr. Omalu a copy of the scene photos, which he downloaded to his computer. Throughout the autopsy
I took photos of the process. Dr. Omalu located the small hard lump on the decedent’s back between the
shoulder blades, made an incision, and retrieved the spent bullet. I photographed the spent bullet and placed it
into a coƩon lined box. Please refer to Dr. Omalu’s report for further details.
The clothing, liner paper, and spent bullet were given to LCDA InvesƟgator Poma. I departed at approximately
0850 hours.
Upon arrival to LCSO Evidence, all photos were uploaded and burned to disc (item 2).

On 11/16/23, at approximately 1400 hours, I responded to
Dixon Dr. in Lakeport, for an oﬃcer involved
shooƟng. Upon my arrival, I contacted depuƟes in the back yard of the residence, near the pool, as they were
removing the suspect and decedent, later idenƟﬁed as Richard Pyorre, from the water.
Lt. Bingham and Deputy Rhine checked Pyorre but were unable to locate a pulse. Deputy Rhine also did not
observe any respiraƟons and stated Pyorre’s pupils were ﬁxed and dilated with no reacƟons.
Medical personnel from StaƟon 50 were called to the scene. Lakeport Fire ProtecƟon District Captain Jordan
Mills connected Richard to an EKG device. Captain Mills observed asystole in all leads of the EKG. On November
16th, 2023, at 1423 hours, Deputy Rhine pronounced Richard Michael Pyorre deceased.
All personnel on scene were removed from the scene and it was secured. Deputy Mendelson started and
maintained a crime scene log. At my request, DetecƟve Newton returned to the Main Oﬃce and authored
Search Warrant 23-267, which was signed by the Honorable Judge Andrew S. Blum, which commanded the
search of the aforemenƟoned property.
Once signed, Evidence Technician Tamara Mitchell took several photographs of the scene and the decedent.
While examining the scene with invesƟgators from the District AƩorney’s Oﬃce, I assisted with the retrieval of
the ﬁrearm that the decedent had been holding, and his cell phone, both of which were sƟll submerged in the
pool.
I removed and inspected the ﬁrearm, which was a Glock 17, 9mm. With Evidence Technician Mitchell taking
photographs, I removed the loaded magazine from the magazine well and rendered the ﬁrearm safe, locking the
slide to the rear. The ﬁrearm was loaded and chambered. I placed the ﬁrearm, magazine and the one round that
was removed from the chamber on the ground so it could be photographed and packaged for evidence.
I was also able to retrieve the cell phone from the pool, which was in a semi waterproof case. Once removed
from the water, I removed the phone from the case and aƩempted to place it in airplane mode but the phone
required a passcode to do so. I then handed the phone to District AƩorney InvesƟgator ScoƩ Poma.
While on scene, I assisted District AƩorney InvesƟgator Bruce Smith with the examinaƟon of the fence where the
decedent had been standing when Sgt. Moore ﬁred the ﬁrst round. We located the area low on the right side of
the fence where the round impacted, passed through the board and through another, before it was lost in the
brush on the backside of the fence. At the conclusion of the scene being processed, the round was not
recovered.

In August of 2023, i believed it could’ve been August 05, 2023, when she and Richard went to a concert.
Their relationship was struggling before the concert because it was during the time frame fi found out Richard
was smoking marijuana. When she and Richard came back from the concert, he talked about wanting to spend
more time with her. | | told Richard she didn’t like him smoking marijuana and she was uncomfortable with
him doing so. a believed the next day after the concert, she was getting dinner and took dinner out to the RV
for Richard. Richard at the time was installing a TV and sound bar in the RV. | | noticed Richard was smoking
marijuana which upset her. This caused an argument between the two because all i wanted to do was spend
time with Richard, but not when he was high. || and Richard did not hang out for the remainder of the night.
After this argument, Richard stayed in the RV for a couple of days. || also said Richard drank for years and at
times was a heavy drinker but eventually stopped and only drank beer.

over a phone call from | | called fii because ia Jeep had broken down. | | didn’t want to

Richard.

to see what was going on. || saw Richard pointing at yelling “| fucking hate her, | want her out of my
fucking life.” ma didn’t say anything because she wanted to speak her mind. Richard always told i not
to talk for their daughters, so she wanted iil to speak for herself. Richard told ii she needed to get a new
father, called everyone freeloaders, got close to fi face, and told il he hated her. This was the first time

| | had ever seen Richard like this.

children kept in contact with Richard. Richard would send them weird things such as twin flames and other
spiritual things. || also kept in contact with Richard’s mother to see how Richard was doing. Richard’s mother
told her that Richard was on the verge of having another mental breakdown, but they talked about things.

On August 27, 2023, and the family returned from Oregon. Richard was home too. Richard hugged fil and
told her he loved her. Richard talked about doing research and believed he had demons from childhood trauma.
| | didn’t know what type of childhood trauma he had. | remembered hearing Richard went to counseling
when he was 16 years old but didn’t know why. Richard talked about how he stopped drinking because he had
one beer and didn’t feel like drinking anymore. Richard talked about spirituality stating the body will reject
something that was poison. Richard stopped drinking but continued smoking marijuana.

Richard mentioned going back to Fort Bragg to help his parents put up computers. Richard had bought laptops
for his parents so they could work more remotely. Working remotely was something Richard did because he
hated work and wanted to spend more time away from the office. Before Richard left for Fort Bragg, nn
asked Richard not to take his firearm with him. Richard took his firearm with him the first time he left for Fort
Bragg. a was concerned Richard would hurt himself with the firearm. Richard reassured he wasn’t
going to hurt himself.

Richard kept a handgun in a locked box underneath his side of the bed. i did not have a key to the lock. ||
placed a piece of duct tape on the gun box so she could tell if it had been opened. || checked underneath the
bed every day to see if the firearm was there every day because of Richard's suicidal statements. | | realized
the firearm was missing when Richard went to visit his parents during the time she was in Oregon at the
wedding.

Before Richard left, he was very emotional and hugged ll not letting her go. Richard kept telling il he was
afraid it was the last time they would hug.

On August 29, 2023, left for work and when she returned home, Richard was gone and had taken the RV.

back and missing her husband. | | agreed and went to Big River to visit Richard for a few hours.

when fi got to Big River, she noticed Richard was really into the spiritual side. He talked about currents,
seeing currents pulled, and a witch appearing from water. | | noticed Richard was trying to not have an angry
outburst because when he was about to get angry, he would calm himself with meditation. They talked about
their future and what it was going to look like. | | and Richard did not decide if they were going to stay
together or not. || told Richard she needed to come to terms and let him heal. After talking with Richard for a
few hours, i left and came back to Lake County. Richard told he would return home in a couple of days.

On September 05, 2023, Richard messaged [ll asking if she needed anything from Costco. He returned home
later that day and gave ll flowers but did not park the RV in its usual parking spot. Instead, he parked the RV in
the driveway stating it would be easier for him to clean out the compartments. Richard did not tell them he
missed them, but instead talked about his adventures hiking and kayaking at Big River. He talked about a log he
had found on the beach which he stood on for about 4 hours for a balance point. Richard then talked about
climbing on another log where he and his dog Levi stood. Richard and Levi watched the energies being pulled.

| | wasn’t sure if he was talking about energy being pulled from the water or air. After talking about his
adventures, Richard said good night and went back out to the RV.

The next morning, Ji went to work, and i stayed home. when fi returned home, she saw the garage
door was open. Richard had everything out of the garage for fun activities such as his bike, surfboard, wet suits,
boogie boards, and camping gear. Richard was moving all those items into the RV. | | believed Richard was
packing to leave again. While Richard was packing, he told he wanted to have a family meeting about
keeping up with the residence and bills. As Richard was coming in and out of the residence gathering his stuff
froma closet, made a joking comment and asked Richard if he was moving out. Richard became angry and
stated he wasn’t staying home and was moving back to Big River. Richard began to call them soul suckers and
told her he didn’t want to be anywhere near them. Richard went out to the RV and got all the bills and brought
them into the residence. Richard told ll and the family they were all in charge of the bills, but also told them
not to worry about them. | | was confused as to what Richard was doing and saying.

| was crying and told Richard he needed help, and she wanted her father back. Richard told she
needed to get a new father. | | told Richard she wanted her father back who was not drunk or high all the
time. | told Richard if he didn’t get help, she didn’t want him around her children or her wedding. | |
did not want someone who talked to her, her sister, and her mother the way he was. This upset Richard because
all he heard was the part where fii didn’t want him around her children or wedding.

On September 07, 2023, Richard left the residence andi did not hear from him again until September 30,
2023, when he called her about changing the PG&E bill into her name. || was confused as to why he did such
a thing. Richard was always the one who took care of all the bills. || never knew how much money was in the
bank account since he was the one who always managed their finances. didn’t know if his family was
keeping the insurance company or not. After his second visit with his family, Richard mentioned tof they
were selling the insurance company because he wanted nothing to do with it.

On October 01, 2023, Richard messaged | again inquiring about their family cat. Richard had received a
phone call from their local veterinarian regarding the missing cat they found. The cat had been missing for about
five years but returned when Richard and Levi were gone. The cat was afraid of the dog. After this conversation,
ma didn’t hear from Richard until he showed up in Lake County.

On October 28, 2023, Richard showed up at the Haunted Lake County event which was located at the old Bank of
America building, located at vain St. in Lakeport. This upset il because she had not heard from him for
so long. While he was gone, and the children were struggling to keep up with the bills. On the same day,

| | oldest sonfiiilarrived from Oregon and had a two-hour conversation with Richard behind their
insurance company office. Richard had mentioned not feeling welcomed at the residence, so he was going to
stay behind the office. Richard stated he had some items delivered under (the dog) Levi's friend’s name. | |
later saw Richard had purchased about $9,000 worth of music equipment such as speakers. This didn’t make a
lot of sense toil because they were struggling with paying the bills.

On October 29, 2023, Richard showed up at the residence and was in the RV. a didn’t talk to him that night
because he didn’t come out of the RV. The following day, saw end Richard having a conversation
outside. It was nearly a six hour conversation. | | could see Richard was doing most of the talking just walking
outside while Bust listened. Richard talked about how he wanted to make their property a nonprofit for a
church or a trailer park. Richard talked about having Haunted Lake County park storage units on their property
and they could charge them to help them pay for mortgage. a felt overwhelmed with what Richard was
saying because they had not discussed things about their relationship. ma didn’t know Richard’s plans and
didn’t even know if she was going to have a home to stay in.

Richard started to put lattice up around the RV and strapped it down. || described the area of the RV as
starting to look like a homeless encampment. Richard took things out of the garage for no reason and started to
pile them up next to the RV. Richard seemed to be getting worse. There was one night Richard got ina face
yelling at her to get out of his face. Another day, i had to go to her boss’s house to work on something for a
few hours because Richard was playing music very loud.

ten years and always worked on the Haunted Lake County together. During the event nights, allowed i

ia to stay at their residence, so he wasn’t going back and forth from Santa Rosa. When they were cleaning

Richard said while moving the boat it got stuck. Richard later admitted he moved the truck and boat to block the
driveway so Haunted Lake County could not get their trailers. Richard went on about how Haunted Lake County
owed them rent and owed them thousands of dollars.

On November 10, 2023, i and i arrived back home. As they arrived, Richard was leaving the residence
and told il the boat was stuck, and he needed a pin out of the suburban that il was driving at the time. | |

back home because she didn’t know what she was going to encounter. || heard Richard was making a lot of

door to keep it secure due to the comments Richard was making. The kids told il Richard saying if anybody
came onto the property, he had poison and gas and was going to set up booby traps. Richard advised them to
not call the fire department because he would kill them.

up and she left the residence. Shortly after, i got a phone call from trailer was on the

reason with him so he could get his trailer. | | told if he didn’t get his trailer, he was going to call law

Z arrived and tried to get Richard's attention by yelling towards the RV asking Richard to move the vehicle
blocking the driveway. Richard wasn’t responding, sof got the keys to the suburban and knocked on the RV
door. Richard opened the door andi told him she had the keys to the suburban so he could get the pin he
needed for the boat trailer. Richard agreed, went to close the RV door, opened it again, and told he was
busy. i told Richard they needed the trailers. Richard closed the RV door and opened it again. This time
Richard started yelling at i telling her to “fuck off’ and to get off his property. Richard started saying they
owed them thousands of dollars and was not making any sense with the things he was saying. At this time

enforcement about the firearm and comments, so they didn’t get ambushed. | know ie is a retired
California Highway Patrol Officer who served for 26.5 years with the department.

 

Lake County Sheriff Deputies arrived and attempted to come to a solution with fi about how to remove the
trailers from the property. || mentioned there being a side gate on the property, but Richard had put a lock on
it. One of the deputies advised he had bolt cutters. and agreed to cut the lock to the gate so the
trailers could be removed. When Richard saw i and cutting the lock, he ran out and started yelling
at them. He was saying he was being betrayed, they were going to be on channel 2 news and Haunted Lake
County was going down.

from Fort Bragg, they did not talk to Richard because they knew he was irrational at the time. ea and Richard’s
parents talked about what may have been going on with Richard. They believed he may be suffering from

Richard started to tell i he didn’t want to talk to anyone until he received the paperwork from the last time
they called law enforcement. Richard wanted everyone out of the residence for a few days so he could figure his
stuff out.

didn’t need help. Richard had a fence post driver in his hands and threw it on the ground. Richard got close to
face and with his right hand pulled out a pocket knife from his right pants pocket. Richard placed the

blade up against his own throat on the right side of his neck telling to “Do it.” Richard then grabbed

f face, by placing his hands on the side of his face and shook head. At this time, ran

Chwialkowski heard three depuƟes were responding to Lucerne for an aƩempted suicide. While the depuƟes
responded to the suicide call, a call came out on Dixon Drive of an assault with a knife, with unknown injuries.
Captain Chwialkowski knew Sergeant Moore was responding to the Dixon Drive call and knew the other deputy
responding would have an extended response Ɵme. Captain Chwialkowski decided to respond to Dixon Drive to
assist Sergeant Moore because he was closer.
As Captain Chwialkowski arrived at the Dixon Drive call, Sergeant Moore who was already on the scene
requested another unit for assistance. As Captain Chwialkowski and Sergeant Moore walked in front of
Dixon Drive, Captain Chwialkowski noƟced the driveway was barricaded, with two vehicles parked across the
driveway. A wire fence was strewn across the driveway as a gate and secured with metal wire to keep it in place.
Captain Chwialkowski saw “Rick Pyorre,” who I know to be Richard, walking in and out of a camper. Based on my
invesƟgaƟon thus far, I know the camper Captain Chwialkowski was talking about was Richard’s RV. Richard was
agitated and yelling, but Captain Chwialkowski couldn’t recall what Richard was yelling. During this Ɵme, Richard
walked to the backyard.
Captain Chwialkowski saw
who was Richard’s neighbor. Captain Chwialkowski knew

reƟred California Highway Patrol Oﬃcer with approximately 30 years of law enforcement experience. Captain
Chwialkowski spoke with

told Captain Chwialkowski, that Richard had been acƟng

described his behavior as something similar to a meth psychosis.
While talking with
, Richard came out of the backyard and walked close to the vehicles blocking the
driveway. Sergeant Moore again aƩempted to communicate with Richard, but he conƟnued to yell at them.
Captain Chwialkowski couldn’t recall what exactly was said by Richard, but it was something similar to not
wanƟng them there and telling them to leave.
At about this Ɵme, Deputy Nakahara and Sergeant Welter from Lakeport Police Department arrived to assist.

Captain Chwialkowski spoke with Sergeant Moore about the nature of the call and determined they needed to
access the property to see if anyone was injured. It was determined they would wait for Richard in front of his
RV to be closer in case they needed to gain control of him for them to check the property for anyone with
injuries.
Before entering the property,
informed them Richard had a knife and had ﬁrearms. Captain Chwialkowski
wasn’t concerned about the ﬁrearm comment
made because he didn’t think
saw a ﬁrearm on
Richard that day. What concerned Captain Chwialkowski was Richard going to the backyard and maybe where he
had a ﬁrearm.
When Richard went to the backyard, Captain Chwialkowski liŌed the wired gate. Sergeant Moore, Welter,
Nakahara, and Captain Chwialkowski went underneath the gate and walked to the front of the RV. Captain
Chwialkowski felt this was the longest Ɵme Richard spent in the backyard. Captain Chwialkowski's concern was
that Richard had a dog with him and he didn’t know if the dog was aggressive. Sergeant Moore, Welter and
Deputy Nakahara stood on the leŌ side of the RV. Captain Chwialkowski stood on the right side of the RV so he
could look down at the gate. The gate led to the backyard and the pool.
Captain Chwialkowski saw Richard walking back to the RV and let the other oﬃcers know his locaƟon but he
didn’t know if they heard him. Captain Chwialkowski heard the dog barking and running towards the leŌ side of
the RV. At that Ɵme the dog gave away their locaƟon. Captain Chwialkowski could hear Sergeant Moore yelling
but didn’t know if he was yelling at the dog or Richard. Captain Chwialkowski heard Sergeant Moore yelling he
was armed; he had a ﬁrearm and was running to the backyard. Shortly aŌer, Captain Chwialkowski heard a
gunshot. Captain Chwialkowski advised Central Dispatch the suspect was ﬁring at law enforcement. Sergeant
Moore conƟnued to yell giving Richard commands. At this Ɵme, Sergeant Moore informed Captain Chwialkowski
he had ﬁred the shot, not Richard. Sergeant Welter updated dispatch informing them oﬃcers had shot.
Captain Chwialkowski leŌ the right side of the RV and joined Sergeant Moore, Welter, and Deputy Nakahara on
the leŌ side of the RV. Sergeant Moore stated he didn’t like the locaƟon they were at and wanted to move to the
front right corner of the residence. Moving to the front right corner of the residence was a beƩer posiƟon of
cover for them since Richard was now armed with a ﬁrearm in the backyard. Captain Chwialkowski didn’t want
to ask Sergeant Moore quesƟons as to what happened because it was not the proper Ɵme to do so. Captain
Chwialkowski assumed Richard had pointed the ﬁrearm at Sergeant Moore and that’s why he had shot.
Sergeant Moore, Welter, Deputy Nakahara, and Captain Chwialkowski all moved up to the front right corner of
the residence. Captain Chwialkowski was now concerned for their safety because he had no visual of Richard,
who could go around the house and back to the front. Captain Chwialkowski was also concerned for the safety of
the public due to a local veterinary clinic next door.
At some point, Sergeant Moore saw Richard. Captain Chwialkowski couldn’t recall exactly what was said by
Sergeant Moore but believed it was something similar to he had a ﬁrearm, don’t do it, and we don’t want to kill
you. Captain Chwialkowski then heard another shot.

AŌer the second shot, Captain Chwialkowski and Sergeant Welter went to the back leŌ corner of the residence.
Captain Chwialkowski believed he heard Sergeant Moore say Richard had jumped in the pool, but knew Richard
was in the pool. Once in the back, Captain Chwialkowski could see Richard’s head in the swimming pool.
Captain Chwialkowski could see Richard's head moving back and forth and he would stop. Captain Chwialkowski
decided to take a closer look and started to walk up to the swimming pool. When Captain Chwialkowski got
closer, he saw Richard making a backward moƟon with his arm. When Captain Chwialkowski saw that, he
believed Richard was sƟll alert and was just waiƟng for them. Captain Chwialkowski backed away again and
waited for addiƟonal depuƟes.
Once addiƟonal DepuƟes arrived, Sergeant Chwialkowski and Sergeant Moore went back to the front of the
residence. SheriﬀHowe, Captain Chwialkowski, and other depuƟes entered the main residence to secure it.
Captain Chwialkowski got to the back bedroom of the residence and could see Richard in the swimming pool.
Richard was moƟonless and Captain Chwialkowski believed Richard was unconscious. Captain Chwialkowski and
SheriﬀHowe stepped out onto the back deck of the residence and determined Richard was deceased.
Captain Chwialkowski and SheriﬀHowe went back to the front of the house. Lieutenant Bingham had arrived on
the scene and had a ballisƟc shield. It was determined depuƟes would approach Richard with the ballisƟc shield.
As they got closer to the swimming pool, Captain Chwialkowski could see blood in the swimming pool and
believed blood was coming out of Richards’s mouth or the wound. Richard was on his back, with most of his
body submerged under the water, but his head. Richard’s right arm was down at the boƩom of the swimming
pool. In Richards’s right hand, he was holding a Glock handgun. Lieutenant Bingham and another oﬃcer pulled
Richard out of the pool. Captain Chwialkowski did not have any other informaƟon to provide. For further
informaƟon refer to the audio recording.

On 11/17/23 at approximately 1433 hours, I was present for a voluntary interview that was provided by Sergeant
Benjamin Moore. The interview was conducted by District AƩorney InvesƟgator John Gregore and ScoƩ Poma.
Also present in the room was Lieutenant Richard Ward, DetecƟve Castellanos, Sgt. Moore’s legal representaƟves
William Baird and Amanda McCarthy.
InvesƟgator Gregore conﬁrmed with Sgt. Moore that he was giving this interview voluntarily and that he had
been allowed to review his body camera recording from the incident. Sgt. Moore conﬁrmed he was prepared to
give a voluntary statement and that he had viewed his body camera. The following is a summary of that
statement.
Sgt. Moore is currently assigned as an administraƟve sergeant for the Lake County Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce. He has other
duƟes that include dealing with department technology, such as mobile computers, radios, and recording
systems. He is also the Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce Ranger Master. In that posiƟon, he supervises and instructs the
department’s ﬁrearms, chemical muniƟons, and less lethal programs. Sgt. Moore is a team leader on a mulƟ-
agency Special Weapons and TacƟcs team for Lake and Mendocino counƟes and supervises the Oﬀ-Highway
Vehicle program.
Sgt. Moore said he slept well the night before and was not working in his normal assignment on 11/16/23. He
was covering a patrol shiŌ for another supervisor who was on vacaƟon that week. He was wearing a green
patrol jumpsuit with department patches on each arm and wearing a brass badge with a department baseball
cap. Sgt. Moore conﬁrmed he was wearing a body camera that day and a standard duty belt. Sgt. Moore
outlined his duty belt conﬁguraƟon starƟng from the buckle and working clockwise, he carries an X 26P taser, key
clip, radio, pepper spray, a single handcuﬀcase, another single handcuﬀcase, an ASP collapsible baton, Sig P 320
9mm pistol, two addiƟonal magazines for the pistol and a ﬂashlight.
Sgt. Moore started his shiŌ at 0600 hours that morning and said he felt ﬁne. He said the morning of his shiŌ was
busy with several calls for service that he and another deputy responded to, as well as the normal duƟes a
supervisor would aƩend to, such as Ɵmecards and staﬃng issues.
Sgt. Moore said right before the call came out on Dixon Drive, he and two other depuƟes were eaƟng lunch. He
said the original call for service was iniƟated by StaƟon 50. Fire Department Staﬀhad contacted their dispatch
center reporƟng a ﬁght involving a knife. Sgt. Moore said he responded to the call but stopped brieﬂy to get a
tourniquet in case someone had been stabbed. He then responded to the call code-three.
As he approached the Dixon address, he turned oﬀhis siren and turned onto Dixon Dr. in Lakeport. As he
approached the driveway, he noƟced it was barricaded but drove by it because he thought there was another
entrance to the residence. He saw several neighbors standing further down the road. When he contacted the

neighbors, they asked if he was there for the ﬁght. They explained there had been a ﬁght between Richard (Rick)
Pyorre and his children. The neighbors said some of the children leŌ, but Sgt. Moore was not able to conﬁrm if
Rick was home alone at that point or not. The neighbors outlined several prior incidents that had taken place at
the residence and said they felt something was oﬀwith Rick, like he had lost it or something to that eﬀect. One
of the neighbors also told Sgt. Moore that Rick possessed a ﬁrearm. Sgt. Moore told them to go back inside the
house and he went back to the driveway that was barricaded.
When he arrived, Deputy Nakahara contacted him via radio and informed him he had been to the residence
previously. He was advised Rick lived in the RV that was parked in front of the residence and that he possessed a
ﬁrearm. Once the radio traﬃc concluded, Sgt. Moore requested addiƟonal units to assist with the incident. As
he did that, Captain Chwialkowski arrived on scene. Sgt. Moore referred to Captain Chwialkowski as Ski for the
remainder of the interview.
Capt. Chwialkowski and Sgt. Moore contacted a neighbor,
who is a reƟred California Highway
Patrol Oﬃcer.
told them about the history with Rick and the previous arguments that had taken place. He
also told him about a large ﬁght that had occurred prior to Sgt. Moore’s arrival and that some of the people had
leŌ. At that Ɵme, they were unable to conﬁrm if all the people had leŌ or if there were sƟll other people inside
the residence and property with Rick.
also said that Rick owned a handgun and menƟoned to
that he
was not going to go to jail, and he was going to have it out. Sgt. Moore interpreted that statement as meaning
Rick was going to ﬁght with law enforcement. Based on the fact the Sgt. Moore knew Rick had a gun, he
assumed Rick would ﬁght with the highest level of force available to him, which was a gun.
They decided based on the informaƟon they had at the Ɵme, they could not determine if Rick was alone or if
someone was on the property who was injured in any way, or possibly dead. The decision was made to enter the
property and determine if anyone required medical assistance.
Sgt. Moore contacted Rick at the fence across the driveway. He said Rick was agitated by his presence and
screaming that he did not want to talk to law enforcement unƟl a report he wanted could be produced. Rick
started walking away and again said he wanted a report from the last Ɵme the Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce responded. Sgt.
Moore started walking towards him and calling out to him by name. Rick conƟnued to walk away, saying he
didn’t want to talk and ﬂipped Sgt. Moore oﬀ. Sgt. Moore believed that based on Rick’s acƟons he was fully
aware that Sgt. Moore was a deputy sheriﬀand was making a choice not to speak to him. Sgt. Moore said Rick
had placed a no-trespassing note on the fence and barricaded the driveway. Rick conƟnued to walk away and
went to the doorway of his RV.
Once at the door, Rick started talking to his dog telling the dog something to the eﬀect of, bite anyone who
comes on the property. Rick then started to move from the RV to the backyard area of the residence and walked
back and forth between the two. Sgt. Moore conƟnued to try and communicate with Rick. While Rick was near
the backyard fence, Sgt. Moore and other depuƟes moved to the RV. He said they intended to be closer to him
when he returned to the RV to try and communicate with him or detain him if necessary so they could safely
check the residence and property for anyone who may have been injured, or even dead.

As Rick and the dog got closer to the RV, the dog alerted to Sgt. Moore’s presence and came aŌer him. Sgt.
Moore pepper sprayed the dog, so he did not get biƩen. When he did this, Rick saw him and became very
agitated and angry. Sgt. Moore said he transiƟoned from his pepper spray to his taser. He began giving orders to
Rick telling him to walk to him. Rick refused to comply and liŌed his shirt with his leŌ hand, exposing a black
pistol in an appendix carry holster. With his right hand, he established a grip on the pistol and drew the pistol up
and out of the holster. Based on Sgt. Moore’s training and experience, he said Rick manipulated his clothing and
ﬁrearm in a manner that indicated he had some sort of training or proﬁciency with his ﬁrearm, as he did so in the
same manner that Sgt. Moore would instruct.
Sgt. Moore dropped his taser and drew his pistol. As he did, Rick moved to the house and fence calling out that
he was armed. Based on Rick’s acƟons, Sgt. Moore said he felt that Rick had no intenƟon to disarm himself or
comply with any commands. Rick eventually moved to the fenced area of the backyard and moved through the
gate taking a posiƟon of concealment behind what Sgt. Moore described as the right side of the gate and fence,
farthest from the residence.
Sgt. Moore informed other depuƟes that Rick was armed. Rick was kneeling behind the fenced area but exposed
so Sgt. Moore could see him. With his leŌ hand, he cycled the gun, which would commonly chamber a round.
Sgt. Moore said he again felt Rick had some sort of training with the gun based on the way he was handling the
ﬁrearm. AŌer cycling the gun, Rick pointed it at Sgt. Moore. Sgt. Moore said he felt Rick intended on shooƟng
him. He felt in fear for his life, did not want to be shot, and did not want to die. Sgt. Moore said his only opƟon
to survive was to shoot Rick, so he ﬁred one round at him. Sgt. Moore said he did not know if the round hit Rick
or not because as soon as he ﬁred, Rick moved more to the right and out of sight.
Sgt. Moore conƟnued to give commands ordering Rick to show him his hands and to drop the gun. At that point,
Sgt. Moore was completely exposed and not behind cover or concealment. He then moved to the right side of
the house or the 1/4 corner of the residence near the garage. This posiƟon oﬀered Sgt. Moore cover and the
ability to conƟnue communicaƟon with Rick.
Sgt. Moore then saw Rick had moved to the rear of the pool area and heard him screaming something about a
gun and the word asshole. As he was standing near the back of the pool, Sgt. Moore conƟnued to give
commands to drop the gun and not to make law enforcement shoot him. Rick sƟll had the gun in his right hand
and was waving it around. Rick then moved around to the front of the pool, established a two-handed grip on
the ﬁrearm, and again pointed it at Sgt. Moore. Again Sgt. Moore did not want to be shot and did not want to
die, so he ﬁred again. He said he knew the round impacted Rick and he saw him fall into the pool and start
splashing around.
Rick became sƟll, but the depuƟes could not tell if Rick was alive or hiding in the pool. DetecƟve Castellanos
arrived on the scene and moved to Sgt. Moore’s locaƟon with a less lethal shotgun. Other oﬃcers were
responding to the scene and starƟng to aƩempt to gain a view of Rick. Captain Chwialkowski advised that Rick
would move from Ɵme to Ɵme, so depuƟes were not sure if he was injured, or waiƟng for them to approach so
he could shoot them.

DepuƟes and other oﬃcers began clearing the residence, RV and outbuildings. Lt Bingham was aƩempƟng to
gain beƩer access to the driveway so the SWAT team could deploy and drive their armored vehicle to the
backyard and make contact with Rick.
Lt Bingham soon determined Sgt. Moore had shot and had him move away from the scene and towards the entry
to the driveway. Once Lt. Bingham had enough personnel, they started moving into the backyard with a ballisƟc
shield for cover. Once contact was made with Rick, it was determined he was deceased and removed from the
pool. Medical personnel soon responded and conﬁrmed Rick was deceased.
Sgt. Moore leŌ the scene with Sgt. Drewrey and went to the Main Oﬃce, where he met with InvesƟgator Poma.
InvesƟgator Poma took photos of Sgt. Moore and took possession of his ﬁrearm.

On November 17, 2023, at approximately 1130 hours, DA InvesƟgator John Gregore and I spoke with Deputy
Michael Nakahara. Deputy Nakahara told us the following in summary.
On November 11, 2023, Deputy Nakahara was dispatched to a telephone detail where he spoke with

vehicle blocking the driveway prevenƟng him access to his trailer.
informed Deputy Nakahara that
husband, Richard Pyorre, had blocked the driveway, was in his RV, and possibly had a ﬁrearm. Richard did not
want to talk to anybody and did not want to let

Deputy Nakahara saw a truck with a boat, parked across the driveway, blocking the driveway.
Deputy Nakahara could hear loud music coming from the RV where Richard was located. Deputy Nakahara
knocked on the RV to speak with Richard. AŌer knocking several Ɵmes, Richard ﬁnally decided to brieﬂy speak
with them, but was shouƟng. Richard didn’t want to talk with Deputy Nakahara and didn’t want to deal with the
trailers. Richard threw a piece of paper towards their direcƟon. The piece of paper was duct taped to the roll of
duct tape. The piece of paper was property tax paperwork. Richard made comments about wanƟng money for
the trailers being parked on the property.
Deputy Nakahara, Sergeant HockeƩ and
were trying to ﬁnd soluƟons on how to get the trailers oﬀof the
property. One of the opƟons was to tow the vehicle blocking the driveway out of the way. The other opƟon was

out of his RV. Richard kept repeaƟng

the trailers were removed from the property, Richard went back inside his RV and the situaƟon was resolved.
On November 16, 2023, Deputy Nakahara was working patrol, driving a fully marked Lake County Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce
patrol vehicle, and wearing a department approved uniform. Deputy Nakahara and Deputy James Rhine were

On their way to the Kelseyville Rivera address, Sergeant Moore got on the radio and requested the last Deputy
responding to the Riviera address to return back to Kelseyville/Lakeport because another call was going to come
out.
Deputy Nakahara and Sergeant Moore were dispatched to
Dixon Drive in Lakeport for the report of an
assault with a knife. Deputy Nakahara knew medical was staging so he and Sergeant Moore responded with
their emergency lights and siren. Sergeant Moore arrived on-scene ﬁrst. Deputy Nakahara informed Sergeant
Moore over the radio he responded to the address recently for a diﬀerent incident where the responsible was
possibly armed with a ﬁrearm. Sergeant Moore acknowledged the informaƟon given by Deputy Nakahara and
requested another Deputy. At about this Ɵme, Captain Chwialkowski arrived to assist.
Deputy Nakahara arrived and was the third Deputy on scene. Deputy Nakahara saw Richard walking from his RV
to the back of the residence, behind a fence with a cart. Richard’s dog was also with him. Richard was taking
items from his RV and taking them to the back yard. Deputy Nakahara saw the driveway was now blocked with
the truck and boat, another vehicle, and a wired fence closing oﬀthe driveway. Sergeant Moore and Captain
Chwialkowski determined they were going to make entry onto the property when Richard walked to the
backyard. The idea was to contact Richard on his way back to the RV.
Sergeant Moore, Deputy Nakahara, Sergeant Welter (LPD) and Captain Chwialkowski went under the fence and
waited for Richard in front of the RV. Sergeant Moore was on the leŌ side of the RV looking back, while Deputy
Nakahara was behind him. Deputy Nakahara heard Captain Chwialkowski say Richard was coming back. At this
point, Sergeant Moore came out from the front of the RV in an aƩempt to contact Richard. Deputy Nakahara
was sƟll behind Sergeant Moore and couldn’t see Richard. When Deputy Nakahara was able to see Richard,
Deputy Nakahara saw Richard take a step back, liŌ his jacket up and reach for his waistband. Richard grabbed a
black handgun from his waistband and began to raise it up. Deputy Nakahara was scared and in fear for his
safety and the safety of his partners when he saw Richard pulling the ﬁrearm from his waistband. Deputy
Nakahara told Richard to put down the ﬁrearm. Sergeant Moore got in front of Deputy Nakahara and Deputy
Nakahara heard a single gunshot ﬁred. Richard then retreated to the back yard. Deputy Nakahara didn’t know
who had shot at that point, because he heard via radio that shots were ﬁred at law enforcement.
Sergeant Moore and Deputy Nakahara aƩempted to use the RV as cover, as much as they could. Deputy
Nakahara didn’t think the RV was cover, but it was more like concealment. Deputy Nakahara was sƟll scared and
had to use the RV to lean up against it, to keep his hands from shaking. Sergeant Moore conƟnued to give

right hand, and that Richard was sƟll moving.
AŌer waiƟng next to the RV, Sergeant Moore determined they needed to move to the front right corner of the
residence. Deputy Nakahara wasn’t sure who else moved up to the front right corner of the residence, but knew
he and Sergeant Moore did. Sergeant Moore approached the corner of the residence ﬁrst. Sergeant Moore and
Deputy Nakahara weren’t right up against the corner of the residence because there was a bush in the way.

Not being able to see Richard was concerning for Deputy Nakahara because he didn’t know if Richard had other
ﬁrearms with him. Deputy Nakahara was also concerned for the safety of others. Deputy Nakahara didn’t know
if anyone was hurt inside the RV, the main residence, or the back yard due to the nature of the call.
Deputy Nakahara heard Sergeant Moore ﬁre a second shot. Deputy Nakahara heard and saw a splash in the
swimming pool. Deputy Nakahara believed Sergeant Moore had hit Richard. Sergeant Moore conƟnued giving
Richard commands. Shortly aŌer, Deputy Nakahara could see Richard’s shoes ﬂoaƟng in the pool and he could
hear more splashing in the swimming pool.
Captain Chwialkowski and Sergeant Welter responded to the back leŌ of the residence to see if they could get a
view of Richard. Sergeant Moore told Deputy Nakahara to wait at the front right side of the residence. Deputy
Nakahara believed Sergeant Moore went to the other side of the residence with Captain Chwialkowski. At about
this Ɵme, other law enforcement oﬃcers arrived and approached Richard with a ballisƟc shield. Deputy
Nakahara didn’t have any other informaƟon to provide.

through a spurt where it would hit him harder and, you know, or something and he'd be more kinda 
25 
depressed, but then he always seemed **** get out of it, you know.  Um, but yeah, he's always, 
26 
always battled from the time I met him, actually, when I got together with him, he told me that he 
27 
was in a dark place and that me and my son at the time saved him then, so but yeah, he's always 
28 
struggled from it, and he has always made it well known with the kids that he struggled from it. 
29 
 
30 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, had, has he ever expressed why he's been like that?  Like, in 
31 
depression mode or – 
32 
 
33 
 
Not really.  Uh, not until just recently, that he, um, so like 3 months is like when 
34 
this really started hah, like, really, this started going bad.  He, um, I noticed that he had been, um, 
35 
smoking weed, and I don't like it, and so I was telling him that I like you smoking weed, blah, blah, 
36 
blah, and he, he was denying it and denying it and denying it and I eventually found it and and 
37 
whatnot and he finally admitted to it and said that he has to, that's the only way he can cope in this 
38 
world.  Um, my brain's all over the place.  I'm sorry. 
39 
 
40 
Other Speaker: 
That's okay. 
41 
 
42 
 
What was – 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: It's – 
45 
 
46 

6 
 
 
– the question that you asked? 
1 
 
2 
Detective Castellanos: **** – 
3 
 
4 
 
I feel like I'm like losing track. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: Has he ever expressed, like, uh, any reason as to why **** – 
7 
 
8 
 
Reasonings.   
9 
 
10 
Detective Castellanos: Yeah. 
11 
 
12 
 
So, lately, it's been work, hates his work.  Hates society, hates um, the world, hates 
13 
people, hates, um, Biden, hates anybody in the health industry.  I mean, it's just eh, pretty much 
14 
anybody, it was hate. 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: Um, **** sounds like he hated work.  What did he do for work? 
17 
 
18 
 
Uh, insurance.  We have – 
19 
 
20 
Detective Castellanos: **** – 
21 
 
22 
 
– 
. 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: – 
.  Okay, um, and how, how long have you guys owned 
25 
that company?  Or who owns that company? 
26 
 
27 
 
Uh, him and his parents. 
28 
 
29 
Detective Castellanos: Him and his parents. 
30 
 
31 
 
And his brother are all co-owners. 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: Co-owners of it.  Um, what are parents names? 
34 
 
35 
 
 and 
.  And they have an office in Fort Bragg also. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos:
 okay, um, and how about the brother's name? 
38 
 
39 
 
That's 
 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos:
  And do they live here? 
42 
 
43 
 
They live in Fort Bragg. 
44 
 
45 

7 
 
Detective Castellanos: Do they know about what happened today?  Okay.  And they all live in Fort 
1 
Bragg? 
2 
 
3 
 
Yeah. 
4 
 
5 
Other Speaker: 
I'm sorry, I came in after.  I'm James Ryan – 
6 
 
7 
 
Hi. 
8 
 
9 
Other Speaker: 
– I'm a, from the Sheriff's Office as well.  I'm gonna have some more 
10 
information for you here – 
11 
 
12 
 
Okay. 
13 
 
14 
Other Speaker: 
– after Detective Castellanos – 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: So, I'll try to ask most of the questions that he's probably going to ask just so 
17 
– 
18 
 
19 
 
Okay. 
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: – there's not **** okay, so he's just here just to be here. 
22 
 
23 
 
Okay.   
24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: Um, so um, uh, okay.  You said that he's never been physical with you, so 
26 
there's never been an instance of any sort of domestic violence with you.  He's never placed hands 
27 
on you.  Any unreported incidents? 
28 
 
29 
 
No. 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: Um, okay.  Has he been physical with your kids in the past? 
32 
 
33 
 
Not in the past, but he was today with my son. 
34 
 
35 
Detective Castellanos: Right, we'll get to that, um, okay.  So, um, from what I understand, things 
36 
started to escalate, like, about 3 months ago.  Ah, apparently he went on a trip to Fort Bragg and, 
37 
and left home, like – 
38 
 
39 
 
He hadn't been speaking to his parents in probably a year, since COVID 'cause they 
40 
are all about the vaccine.  He wasn't about the vaccine.  He hated his job and wanted to like have 
41 
'em sell it.  They didn't wanna sell it, so they all had like a battle, they weren't speaking **** I don't 
42 
know, maybe a year, I wanna say, that they weren't speaking, but minimal, and their, I, I didn't 
43 
witness it, but I've heard that he's been pretty vocal over the phone from the off, **** the gal at the 
44 
office with his parents.  Um, so he, uh, this is hard 'cause he was – 
45 
 
46 

8 
 
Detective Castellanos: It's okay, yeah, take your time.  **** – 
1 
 
2 
 
We, well, he went on a, um, we went to a concert and it's kind, days before that, we 
3 
were kind of like rocky.  It was when the whole thing about the weed thing was coming out and me 
4 
not liking it and, you know, and this and that, but I always seemed, like, any time that he got angry, 
5 
I always felt like I was the one that like accepted it and like forgived and like moved on to like 
6 
deescalate it, you know, what I'm saying, in a way.  And, um, there was a lot of alcohol, took, but 
7 
um, we went to a concert and we came back and, um, he had been talking about, um, wanting to 
8 
spend more time together and I told him that when he's high, 'cause he's up here, and I'm down 
9 
here, we're on two different levels, and I can't, I'm uncomfortable being around him 'cause I don't 
10 
know how to be at your level, and um, we got back and we stayed in the house, the night we got 
11 
back, and then the next day, we were hooking up, um, we got a new TV and sound bar for the RV 
12 
on our way back from the trip, and I came in and I went dinner, and I went to bring him dinner, and 
13 
when I came out there, I could tell that he had smoked, and I confronted him, I was like, really?  I'm 
14 
like, I wanted to come out here and spend time with you and whatnot, and you have to, you know, 
15 
why do you have to always be high or whatever, and then, he, um, he said it's not up for discussion.  
16 
I've told you, we're not discussing it, and um, I said, well, I wanted to hang out with you.  And he's 
17 
like, well, I didn't say you couldn't hang out with me, and I said, well, not if you're high, and he's 
18 
like, well, it looks like you're not, so then I went in the house, and he stayed out in the RV for 
19 
2 days.  I think it was two nights, and, um, he went to and from work.  We saw him come in.  He'd 
20 
get clothes and he'd go to work.  Shower, go to work, um, just brief talk about hooking up the 
21 
soundbar, you know, just short talk, and then, excuse me, um, my daughter went to 
 ****, 
22 
 to sign up for college classes and he had just bought her a new Jeep, a new Jeep, and uh, 
23 
she called me and she said, hey, my Jeep's not starting and I don't wanna call dad 'cause he's 
24 
probably just gonna get mad because he just spent all his money on this Jeep and he's, that the 
25 
whole reason, is buy a nice Jeep that it's not gonna break down because the other car broke down 
26 
that he bought for my son, and so that was another thing that he was angry about, and um, I said, 
27 
well, 'cause she had her boyfriend with her, and he works on cars, and I said, well, just see if 
28 
 can, like, see if it needs to be jumped or whatever, and she said, okay.  I ran to the store 
29 
and I came back, and I guess it didn't work, and he was on the phone in the other room, and he was 
30 
yelling at 
 on the phone, and 
 um, was like, well, I just needed, I just didn't know 
31 
what to do, you know, 'cause the way he's been before it would have been, like, if her boyfriend 
32 
would have touched it, he would have got mad if something went wrong 'cause then it woulda been 
33 
her boyfriend's problem, you know, he did something, so there was like no win win, so they were 
34 
like, you know, and he got mad and yelled.  My other daughter, 
 was in the front room, and 
35 
she said, dad, just calm down.  She just called you for guidance.  She just wanted to a, a opinion, 
36 
you know, what to do.  She didn't know what to do.  Call, do I call a tow truck, do I see if I **** 
37 
here, do I let 
 look at it, and then he just went off and was like, I have no guidance in this 
38 
fucking world, and I'm no guidance for anybody and I **** I mean, he said mean things. 
39 
 
40 
Other Speaker: 
When was this? 
41 
 
42 
 
So, it was, without looking at the calendar – 
43 
 
44 
Other Speaker: 
Okay, **** – 
45 
 
46 

9 
 
 
– August, so August 5th, we went to the concert, and then it was 3 days after that, 
1 
roughly. 
2 
 
3 
Other Speaker: 
**** got it. 
4 
 
5 
 
Maybe 4 days.  Um, and then he blew up at 
 and I was in the other room – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: This is still during this time frame? 
8 
 
9 
 
Yeah, the same argument.  I don't know if you want all this detail or not but – 
10 
 
11 
Detective Castellanos: Yes, please.  **** – 
12 
 
13 
 
Okay. 
14 
 
15 
Detective Castellanos: – everything. 
16 
 
17 
 
And so, I was in the other room, and he was like pointing.  He's like, I fucking hate 
18 
her and I want her out of my fucking life, and I didn't say anything, 'cause I wanted my daughter to 
19 
be able to like speak her mind because he was always saying that I talk for them.  I talk for them, 
20 
and I, I had talked for them because they were afraid to talk for themselves, so if they said 
21 
something, I'm like, they, they don't want you doing it, you know, whatever, and um, so I was like, 
22 
I've just gotta let her speak her mind and whatever, and God, she was crying and she was telling 
23 
him that she just wanted her dad and he told her that she needed to get a new dad and that we were 
24 
all, uh, freeloaders in the house, and, um, he didn't wanna be around us and, uh, I mean, oh, God, it 
25 
hurt, it hurt, it hurt him.  It was like the first time I've ever seen him, like, at a really bad low, and 
26 
my son was upstairs, and he came down, and he was like whoa, whoa, whoa, and he was like, **** 
27 
sorry, 
, I love you, and he was slamming the door, and I thought he was gonna throw his 
28 
laptop.  I thought he was gonna throw his phone.  He got like this close to my face and told me that 
29 
he hated my fucking guts, and 
 my daughter, wasn't there, but she heard when they got 
30 
back.  My daughter told her the whole thing because it was her Jeep, and so she felt guilty and um, 
31 
I think Rick stayed in the RV another day or two after that, and he came in and said, um, if you 
32 
wanna talk, I wanna talk, and I was like, okay.  So, we went down by the pool, and we were down 
33 
there talking, and he was like cr, crushed soul, I mean, I've never seen him, like, that low before, 
34 
and, and he's had **** other outbursts and it, it, with his brother on Thanksgiving, and that wasn't 
35 
good either, but um, this is the first time I've seen him, like, felt like he was like at the lowest of 
36 
low, and he apologized and said that I never should talk to anybody like that, look at my kids like 
37 
that, and I'm so sorry, I hope you'll forgive me and all this stuff, and then I told him that I don't 
38 
know if I can do that anymore because he'd been kinda, I mean, if you ask the kids, he's been kinda 
39 
belittling me.  Like, through our whole marriage, off and on, and like I said, I always just kinda 
40 
took it, and um, I was kind of at that point where I was like, **** I can't do it anymore, and I feel 
41 
bad because I feel like if I would have just do what I usually would have done, then none of this 
42 
would have fucking happened.   
43 
 
44 
Other Speaker: 
This is not your fault at all.  I know he loved.  I know he did.  **** loved the 
45 
kids and.  So, anyways, he, we were supposed to go to a wedding for my older son's best friend's 
46 

10 
 
getting married in Oregon, and we were all gonna take a trip up there in the RV, and this happened, 
1 
so we both agreed that it'd be best that we just kinda like take some time and he was gonna go to 
2 
Fort Bragg and have a meeting with his family, with his parents and try to like clean, you know, 
3 
make mends with them and me and the kids went to the wedding.  Um, we talked back and forth.  
4 
Um, he was talking back and forth with the kids, but he was trying to heal himself through like a 
5 
spiritual side.  Like, I've never seen, like, that before.  Like, um, uh, not like a church spiritual.  
6 
Like, um – 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Mm hmm.   
9 
 
10 
Other Speaker: 
Meditating and stuff like that? 
11 
 
12 
 
– yeah, like meditating and, um, oh, God – 
13 
 
14 
Other Speaker: 
Was he doing some like YouTube type stuff or – 
15 
 
16 
 
Yeah, he was sending me like lots of like, and the kids a lot of like those weird, I 
17 
mean, I thought they were kind of weird.  It's not something I'm used to, but um, like twin flames 
18 
and spiritual things and your body and, um, light beings and um, yeah, it just, it just keeps getting 
19 
like odd.   
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
22 
 
23 
 
So, **** lose track.  Um, so I was texting his mom or talking back and forth.  He 
24 
was there and she said he was like on a verge of having a mental breakdown while he was there, 
25 
but they talked a lot and things were going good.  He stopped drinking alcohol.  'Cause that was a 
26 
daily thing.  He'd come home from work and he would drink and he'd smoke and he'd go down the 
27 
pool and isolate himself.  Um – 
28 
 
29 
Other Speaker: 
How long had that been going on? 
30 
 
31 
 
Probably years.   
32 
 
33 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
34 
 
35 
 
A couple of years probably.  I mean, and it, and it would change.  There was times 
36 
where he was going through bottles of whiskey and coke.  You know, he'd make a couple a drinks 
37 
a night, and like, and each, each drink had like three or four shots involved in it, so that's kind of a 
38 
lot for a person.  Um, for one night, and, and then, and then he had an episode, um, with my kids 
39 
and their friends one night, and it seems like after that, he, um, he stopped drinking the hard 
40 
alcohol and just kinda went straight to beer.  But um, when he came back from visiting his parents, 
41 
he said, oh, I had one beer, and I didn't really feel like drinking it, he's like, and then I had another 
42 
one, my body like threw it up and something about, like, I don't know, with his spiritual stuff, and 
43 
he said that your body will reject stuff that's poison and I, I don't really know.  Um, so he stopped 
44 
drinking, but he still continued with the, the weed as far as I know.  But he, he stayed there 
45 
probably a week, I wanna say.  Five days maybe, with his parents, and they all talked and things 
46 

11 
 
were going good and it seemed like everything was fine.  I came back from Oregon with the kids.  
1 
He was there when we got back.  He liked hugged me and he was like, I love, and I've like done a 
2 
lot of research and, um, I think I have maybe demons from when I was a kid that I need to deal 
3 
with.  Trauma, childhood trauma that maybe I need to deal with as a, from a child.  Um, like, 
4 
research in that **** I don't, see there's a lot of stuff that was said between him and his parents that 
5 
I don't know that's he's opened up with my kids, my, my older boys, so they may tell you of more 
6 
things that went on with that, but um, so anyways, he hugged me, he told me he was sorry.  I told 
7 
him, I know you're sorry 'cause I, I definitely knew he was regretful for what he did.  I could feel he 
8 
was, from the bottom of his heart, was.  Then he told me he was gonna go back to his parents 'cause 
9 
he was gonna help them.  He, thought bought computers.  He was gonna help them hook up some 
10 
laptops for his dad so that he could more, work more remote and that's kinda what he did, too.  
11 
Prior to this, he bought a laptop so he could start working more remote and not having to go in the 
12 
office so much.  Um, 'cause he hated his job.  There's days where he would sleep three days and not 
13 
come out of the room 'cause he just didn't wanna go to work, and then he'd come out and he'd brag 
14 
about how he lost this weight and he slept 3 days, and we're just like, that's not good.  You know, 
15 
we'd have to, like, open the door and make sure he's like rolled over to like make sure he's alive and 
16 
he, anytime we'd bring it up, he'd say that he would hope that he wouldn't wake up.  You know, I 
17 
hope that I **** wouldn't wake up.  And that's why he sleep that long.  And then, um, she he told 
18 
me he was gonna go see his parents.  I thought it was like a couple days, 'cause that's what it 
19 
sounded like he was saying.  I wasn't sure if he was gonna take the RV or if he was going to, um, 
20 
drive.  I was at work, and um, I came back and he, he took the RV, and he went up there, and I 
21 
thought okay, well, he's gonna be up there for a little big, and he'll come back, and um, I was 
22 
talking to his mom, and what did she say.  Oh, 'cause I hadn't heard from him.  And I was like, hey, 
23 
have you heard from Rick.  I just don't want him to be alone because he did take his gun.  He had, 
24 
um, a handgun that was under our bed, and that was what 
 my son, was most wor, worried 
25 
about, the very first initial argument.  Um, and I had like went to the extent of, like, it was locked 
26 
and tied under our bed with a lock.  I didn't have the key to it, and he had some like chain thing.  
27 
Um, but I put duct tape over it, so I could tell if it had been opened, um, and I checked it ever day 
28 
that I came home from work and it was there, and then one night I came home and it wasn't.  And 
29 
my son, 
 when he left to go to Ford Bragg for the second time, he was very emotional.  That 
30 
was another thing, he was overly emotional.  Like, I've never seen him cry that much, you know.  
31 
So, that's why I was like, I felt like he was very remorseful for what he did, the argument that he 
32 
did, 'cause he was uncontrollably crying.  He couldn't like talk to us without like crying and saying 
33 
how sorry he was and 
 told him that he didn't want him to bring the gun 'cause he didn't 
34 
want him to hurt himself, and he promised he wouldn't.  He was like, I would never do that.  I'm not 
35 
gonna do that, but yet, he's said many of times to us how he doesn't wanna be here and that, you 
36 
know, he wished that he would go with 
 which is my kid's godfather who committed **** 
37 
suicide during COVID.  Um, **** I can't. 
38 
 
39 
Detective Castellanos: It's okay.  You're doing great.   
40 
 
41 
 
I'm trying. 
42 
 
43 
Detective Castellanos: You are.   
44 
 
45 
 
It's like my brain's just all over the place, and I'm just. 
46 

12 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: Just take your time, and, and if you need a break, just let us know.  At any 
2 
point in time, just let us know.   
3 
 
4 
Other Speaker: 
I can grab ya some water, too, if you need or anything like that? 
5 
 
6 
 
Okay.  Um, so 
 told him he didn't want him to take the gun, and so I was 
7 
worried and I, and I wanted to make sure that he wasn't alone when he was with his parents, and 
8 
um, she said that he was, he was doing okay and that he went Big River, and so he was, he went to 
9 
Big River, and um, he was there for about a month or whatever leh, left that 2 week whatever, so 
10 
probably like 2 weeks, maybe a month.  He was, um, at Big River, and we'd text every morning, 
11 
like – 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: So – 
14 
 
15 
 
– love yous and – 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: – I'm sorry – 
18 
 
19 
 
Mm hmm. 
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: – so he left for a second time after he came back, correct? 
22 
 
23 
 
He went, so he, he initially left and tried to fix things with his parents, which he did.  
24 
Came back and then he left again to help with the laptop – 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: When did he leave the first time when he went with his parents?  That's 
27 
when you went to the wedding in Oregon – 
28 
 
29 
 
Yes – 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: – right? 
32 
 
33 
 
– uh huh. 
34 
 
35 
Detective Castellanos: Do you remember when that was? 
36 
 
37 
 
**** that was like the 4 days I though I said somewhere – 
38 
 
39 
Detective Castellanos: In August? 
40 
 
41 
 
– that, huh?   
42 
 
43 
Detective Castellanos: It was in August, right?  So – 
44 
 
45 
 
Yes. 
46 

13 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: – 'cause you guys went to the concert August 5th, and then 3 to 4 days, that's 
2 
when – 
3 
 
4 
 
Within that week – 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: – that – 
7 
 
8 
 
– **** – 
9 
 
10 
Detective Castellanos: – argument ensued. 
11 
 
12 
 
Yes. 
13 
 
14 
Detective Castellanos: That was with your daughter, 
 right? 
15 
 
16 
 
Yes. 
17 
 
18 
Detective Castellanos: And that's what – 
19 
 
20 
 
And myself, but it was mostly targeted toward 
 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: And that's what he had regrets and – 
23 
 
24 
 
Yes, 'cause he – 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: – **** – 
27 
 
28 
 
– said – 
29 
 
30 
Detective Castellanos: – because he told her he hated her, right? 
31 
 
32 
 
He told, he called us moochers, and he hated her, he hated – 
33 
 
34 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
35 
 
36 
 
– all of us, that he didn't wanna be around us, and he couldn't stand us and – 
37 
 
38 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
39 
 
40 
 
Yeah. 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: So, then after that, you told him that you didn't wanna go through it 
43 
anymore, but – 
44 
 
45 
 
Yeah, we had the big long 9-hour talk. 
46 

14 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: Was that that same day during, um, or from that argument that ensued, or 
2 
was that like a different day? 
3 
 
4 
 
It was like 2 days after that, that, that argument ensued. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: And that's – 
7 
 
8 
 
And then he – 
9 
 
10 
Detective Castellanos: – the talk by the pool, right? 
11 
 
12 
 
Yes, and then – 
13 
 
14 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, got it. 
15 
 
16 
 
– he went to Fort Bragg. 
17 
 
18 
Detective Castellanos: And then he went to Fort Bragg for – 
19 
 
20 
 
And then – 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: – five to seven, the 5 days to a week? 
23 
 
24 
 
Yeah, it was like 5 days, while we were at the wedding. 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
27 
 
28 
 
And then he made mends with his family – 
29 
 
30 
Detective Castellanos: Came back – 
31 
 
32 
 
– which was everything we thought was going good.  Um, he came back, um, for a 
33 
few days and then went back again to help his parents with the computers, from what I thought. 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
Mm. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: But was it at that time that you checked that the gun wasn't there now? 
38 
 
39 
 
Uh – 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: Or is that a different incident? 
42 
 
43 
 
Oh, I don't know.  It was one of the trips.  I think it was the second trip.  Yeah, so it 
44 
was the second trip after he, after we had the 9-hour talk, 'cause I told him down there, I said, your 
45 

15 
 
son knows that you took the gun.  And so, he's like, I'm not gonna hurt myself.  It's not that, it's just, 
1 
you know, so it was – 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: So, the second – 
4 
 
5 
 
– when he, it was when we went, um, when he went to make mends with his, with 
6 
his parents. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: She he took the gun that, that time? 
9 
 
10 
 
Yes. 
11 
 
12 
Other Speaker: 
The first trip? 
13 
 
14 
 
Yes. 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: The first trip? 
17 
 
18 
 
'Cause I talked about it with him down by the pool, so it – 
19 
 
20 
Detective Castellanos: Got it. 
21 
 
22 
 
– was – 
23 
 
24 
Other Speaker: 
**** that? 
25 
 
26 
 
Yes. 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
29 
 
30 
 
Yes. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: So, so and you said that gun was secured un, or a handgun, right? 
33 
 
34 
 
It was a handgun a, like a little, I don't even know what it is.  I've never seen it – 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
37 
 
38 
 
– but. 
39 
 
40 
Detective Castellanos: What color is it? 
41 
 
42 
 
It was a gray handgun **** box. 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
45 
 
46 

16 
 
 
And it had like a wire that was attached to it. 
1 
 
2 
Detective Castellanos: But you said you never seen the gun? 
3 
 
4 
 
Maybe, like, when we first got together it was something that he showed me that he 
5 
got – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Did it look like this or did it look – 
8 
 
9 
 
I think it was gray, but it was like that size, I think. 
10 
 
11 
Detective Castellanos: This size, okay.   
12 
 
13 
 
It was small – 
14 
 
15 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
16 
 
17 
 
– 'cause the box was like eh, by, eh.   
18 
 
19 
Detective Castellanos: And so, then that was kept underneath you guys' bed. 
20 
 
21 
 
Yes, on his side of the bed. 
22 
 
23 
Detective Castellanos: On his side of the bed.  Um, and it was registered to him?  Oh, okay. 
24 
 
25 
 
I have no idea. 
26 
 
27 
Detective Castellanos: But it was his gun? 
28 
 
29 
 
It was his  gun, yeah. 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so then, he took that gun on the first trip and then that's when you 
32 
realized – 
33 
 
34 
 
And he may have – 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: – that it was gone. 
37 
 
38 
 
– had other guns, too, 'cause I know that he had other guns in the garage locked up 
39 
in like a cupboard type thing. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: In like a safe? 
42 
 
43 
 
It wasn't really a safe.  It was like a, um, like a file cabinet that had – 
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: Oh, okay. 
46 

17 
 
 
1 
 
– a lock. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: Got it. 
4 
 
5 
 
And then he had, he had stuff in there.  I don't know what.  I know he had stuff that 
6 
was his grandpa's and, um, like bigger guns, I think. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, and so, you said that you put tape on the box of the gun. 
9 
 
10 
 
Uh huh. 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: And you did that for what reason again? 
13 
 
14 
 
To see if it got opened.  See if he would ever take it out and without my knowledge 
15 
and just leave the box there. 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, and why were you concerned about that? 
18 
 
19 
 
Because he said he didn't wanna be, be alive.  He hated his life – 
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
22 
 
23 
 
– and all that stuff, and that, yeah, that he wishes that his, or my kids' grandpa, or 
24 
grand, yeah, grandfather or – 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: Godfather. 
27 
 
28 
 
– godfather. 
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah. 
31 
 
32 
 
Sorry. 
33 
 
34 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
35 
 
36 
 
Would have taken him with him and like our dog, you know, when he passed away, 
37 
he'd always say things like that, like, I wish I would go with them, and you know, I don't, wish I 
38 
wouldn't wake up in the morning.  You know, and when you have somebody that talks like that all 
39 
the time, I mean, we don't know. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: Right, okay. 
42 
 
43 
 
You know, so it was always a fear that, that that could happen even though he 
44 
always said he wouldn't.   
45 
 
46 

18 
 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so your main concern of that firearm was that he was gonna commit 
1 
suicide with it. 
2 
 
3 
 
That he would hurt himself, yes. 
4 
 
5 
Detective Castellanos: That he was hurt himself, okay.  Thank you for clarifying that with me. 
6 
 
7 
 
Yeah. 
8 
 
9 
Detective Castellanos: Um, okay, so then he left a second time.   
10 
 
11 
 
Yeah, so he – 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: Uh – 
14 
 
15 
 
– left the second time to help – 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: – when did he leave the second time?  Do you remember the date? 
18 
 
19 
 
I don't.  I mean, if I had my phone on me, I probably coulda looked up dates, but um 
20 
– 
21 
 
22 
Other Speaker: 
How long was he home for between the first trip – 
23 
 
24 
 
I wanna say – 
25 
 
26 
Other Speaker: 
– and the second – 
27 
 
28 
 
– it was just 2 or 3 days. 
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: So – 
33 
 
34 
Other Speaker: 
**** pretty quickly. 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: – sometime in August again. 
37 
 
38 
 
Yeah. 
39 
 
40 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
41 
 
42 
 
It was like just a few days.  Um, 'cause we got back on, we got back on a Sunday, 
43 
and I think he said he was going to go on a Tuesday, but he may have left Wednesday. 
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.   
46 

19 
 
 
1 
 
Um – 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: And where did he go – 
4 
 
5 
 
– but he, when he left, he went to Fort Bragg to – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Fort Bragg. 
8 
 
9 
 
– to – 
10 
 
11 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
12 
 
13 
 
– be with his parents.  They had like uh RV pad there that they parked on.  They had 
14 
a whole hookup, so – 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
17 
 
18 
 
– it was, you know, and he was having a good time from what I thought there, but 
19 
he was like, as I said, he was very emotional again when he left, like crying again and like wouldn't 
20 
like, um, like not hold me.  I mean, he wouldn't let go of me and he kept telling me that he was like 
21 
afraid that it was our last time that we'd ever hug, kinda, you know, and stuff, and, um. 
22 
 
23 
Detective Castellanos: Can you check if the chaplin is here yet? 
24 
 
25 
Other Speaker: 
She is.  Yeah, um, do you, did you wanna speak with the chaplin at all or – 
26 
 
27 
 
I don't even, I don't even know.   
28 
 
29 
Other Speaker: 
Okay.  She's – 
30 
 
31 
 
I don't even know what I'm supposed to.  I'm so lost – 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: Why don't we bring 'em in here just so **** – 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
She's, she's very nice.  She's actually an employee of the fire department, 
36 
and she does chaplin services for us, for the fire department, um, so she's seen a lot of life, and she 
37 
can kinda help guide you through everything, which, uh, we can too, let me go grab her really 
38 
quick.   
39 
 
40 
 
So, he was very emotional when he left, so I was concerned, so I like messaged her 
41 
and wanted to make sure that he wasn't alone, and she said that he was, oh, sorry, he was in Big 
42 
River, and he wasn't getting like service or something she said.  I think it was Big River or **** 
43 
Jughandle or something right, uh, in that area because I had messaged him and we weren't getting 
44 
anything, so I was worried and then, uh, he said that he eventually had got a hold and he said that 
45 
he was just gonna stay there for a while, so we were texting every morning, like, I love you.  He 
46 

20 
 
would send me photos.  He was sending me, I was sending him photos and like good nights and 
1 
heart emojis and all that stuff, but he was, um, after he said all those mean things to the kids, and 
2 
that he was sending pictures of like going kayaking and having like, um, I don't, hikes and things 
3 
and stuff like that, and it was like kind of hurting us in a way, like, here we are, 'cause when he left, 
4 
he also said that, um, God, everything is just jumbling up.  No, I think that was the, there's another 
5 
blow ups that I think **** comes to.   
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: It's okay.  You're ****. 
8 
 
9 
 
Um, we just didn't know what was going on.  We just didn't know what, you know, 
10 
'cause there wasn't a whole lot of communication and that was what was lacking, and we all were 
11 
agreeing that we need to communicate more and we need to talk and like let people know how 
12 
we're feeling and, and all this stuff and even his parents were saying the same thing, there needs to 
13 
be more communication.  He was bottling up a lot and he may have, he may tell them way more 
14 
than I even know because they had this huge talk and I haven't even had a chance to even talk to his 
15 
parents about what was going down the last, the first time I'm seen since all this was just over the 
16 
last, this weekend when we had the last, um, incident.  Um, but yeah, he, he started a family group 
17 
chat and he was sending photos and sh, showing us everything that he was doing, um.  I went and 
18 
saw him, uh, one of the mornings he messaged me, and he said, you should, you should come see 
19 
me if you don't have anything to, if you're not doing anything.  Hi. 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
Hi. 
22 
 
23 
 
And, um – 
24 
 
25 
Other Speaker: 
I'll take that. 
26 
 
27 
 
– I wasn't sure if I wanted to because I knew if I saw him, I'd probably fall into that 
28 
same routine where it's like, that's my husband, and I miss him and, but I wound up seeing him 
29 
anyways, and I noticed that when I got there, he was, um, really into the spiritual side, talking 
30 
about currents and seeing currents being pulled and a witch coming from the little water and 
31 
appeared, a witch appeared and just stuff like that.  Um, I noticed that he was having like this, 
32 
trying to like not have the out, outburst of anger that he was having, 'cause he would like get 
33 
angered and then he'd be like, and he like was calming himself down like with meditation I guess, 
34 
or trying to like calm himself down, um, and then, uh, I saw him.  I was there probably like 4 hours, 
35 
maybe, and we talked about, like, what our future is gonna look like.  We didn't like decide on 
36 
anything whether we were gonna stay together or not.  I just told him that I needed to come with 
37 
terms that, um, whatever it took for him to heal **** was there, 'cause he said he, he needed to 
38 
heal, he needed to figure it out himself and heal and like find what's causing him to feel the way he 
39 
was feeling and whatnot, and it seemed like whatever he was doing with this medication and stuff 
40 
seemed to be a positive thing for him.  It seemed like it was working.  Um, for me, being married to 
41 
him for that long and seeing him like change like personalities so fast, 'cause it was like day and 
42 
night type thing, it was kind of odd for me, and I was like, you know, I was like, I don't know, you 
43 
know, I'm like, what, but whatever it takes for you to get better, whether we're together in the end 
44 
or not, I, I want you to be happy, and I told him that I was sorry if I didn't make him happy, and we 
45 
hugged for a long time, and I told him that I loved him and that I missed him, and I told him that 
46 

21 
 
I've missed him for quite a while because he hasn't quite been there lately, and we both cried a lot, 
1 
and we hugged each other, probably it seemed like, an hour is what it seemed like, and then I left 
2 
and I told him how hard it was for me to leave because being my husband, that I wanted to stay, but 
3 
I knew it wasn't probably right for me to stay because we still needed to work on things, and he 
4 
needed this time to heal, and he said that he would be home in like 2 days.  So, I left and I told him 
5 
I, how much I loved him, and I messaged him how much I loved him, then I told him when I got 
6 
back and, and so it was like 2 days later, I wanna say it was a Wednesday, he showed, he called me 
7 
and said, do I need anything from a Costco, and um, I told him there's a handful of things, and he 
8 
said, okay, he was gonna pick them up, and that he's gonna be home, and he just showed up at the 
9 
house and he brought me flowers, and me and the kids were all hopeful that he was like coming to 
10 
stay 'cause it sounded like that's what he was gonna do, and he had brought the flowers, and we had 
11 
like a spot where he usually parked the RV and he didn't.  He like pulled it into the driveway, and, 
12 
um, I was like, **** met him out there, and he gave me the flowers, and I was gonna help him, like, 
13 
back into the area, and he's like, oh, I'm just gonna leave it right here, 'cause it's easier to clean out 
14 
underneath the compartments, and I thought maybe he was just unpacking or whatever.  Um, and 
15 
so he comes in the house and, um, he didn't like say, like, hey, I missed you guys or anything.  It 
16 
was all about his adventures that he went on and how, um, he did all these kayaking and hikes and 
17 
bike rides, no, no, he didn't bike ride yet, but kayaks and hikes and, um, how the kids should do it 
18 
and all this stuff, but the kids were hurt because they're like, you basically left us?  And we're all 
19 
here, like, not knowing if our dad's ever gonna come back, and mom's struggling and we're all 
20 
struggling and, and he's just basically bragging about like his trip and stuff, but in his mind, he was 
21 
wanted us to know he was okay, I guess, is what he was saying, but in the same sense, he was like 
22 
telling us how, um, he had sent me a picture of a log that washed up on the beach, and um, he said 
23 
my past or future present or something.  I was kinda confused with it, I didn't know what it meant, 
24 
and he sent like a laughy face, and then, uh, he told us and the kids that it washed up and he stood 
25 
on it for a balance point, but he stood on it for 4 hours, like, I was like, okay, that's kinda weird, and 
26 
the kids were like, mkay, that's kinda weird, and um, yeah, it wasn't like, I don't know.  It wasn't the 
27 
warm welcoming that I think everybody was hoping for when he got back and then to hear, like, all 
28 
the things that he was doing and then the standing on the long for 4 hours and then climbed up on 
29 
another log and him and Levi sat and watched all the energies be pulled in and out, like, I don't 
30 
know, the water or eh, I don't know, air, I don't know, and um, so he said, all right, well, goodnight 
31 
and he went back out to the RV.  The next morning, I got up and I went to work, my daughter 
32 
stayed home, and uh, by the time I got back to the house later that afternoon, he had everything out 
33 
of the garage of any fun.  You know, he like had his bike on there, his surfboard, his wet suits, 
34 
boogie boards, all the camping gear, all this stuff, he was moving it into the RV and 
 when I 
35 
got in the house, she's like, uh, she's like, he's just packing to leave again.  You know, and I was 
36 
like, oh, I don't know, and that day he said that he wanted to get the kids together and have a, um, 
37 
meeting to talk about what the bills are gonna look like 'cause he had like told us that now we are 
38 
all in charge of the bills.  Like, me and the kids are paying everything, and he wanted to try to 
39 
figure that out, like, whether we were gonna keep the house or whatever and so, it didn't sound like 
40 
he had any intentions on staying.  Um, so anyways.  I got home and I called my older son, and I 
41 
said, hey, did dad reach out to you about wanting to have a meeting tonight, and he's like no.  And 
42 
honestly, tonight's not a good night because he'd been drink, like, my son had been drinking with 
43 
his buddies, and I was like, okay.  And um, we're just sitting there on the couch and my other son 
44 
wasn't home there, it was just me and my two daughters, and he came in, and he was coming in and 
45 
out of the garage, and he was like **** hauling stuff off, and then he came in and we have upstairs, 
46 

22 
 
a closet, and in there, he's got like some of his personal music, um, stuff up there, and stuff, black 
1 
lights and just his, like, it's his little man cave where he stores kind of his, his fun things, and we 
2 
have a cage, a rat cage in front of it, and he was hey, hey, how hard is it to move the rat cage that's 
3 
in front of the closet up there, and I like, I'm like, oh, it's not too bad.  I'm like, I can move it, and 
4 
then, I was like, what are you doing, moving out?  But I said it so jokingly as I passed by him and 
5 
the girls were sitting there, and he goes, yeah, with like anger, and he's like, I ain't staying here.  
6 
He's like, I'm moving back to Big River.  He's like, you guys are all fucking soul suckers, and I 
7 
don't wanna be anywhere near you guys, and he went out to the RV, got all the bills, brought 'em 
8 
in, said here.  But in the same sentence, he's like, you guys are all in charge of paying these, but in 
9 
the same sentence, he's like, but don't worry about it.  You know, save your money and this and 
10 
that, and I'm like, okay, for one, he's never wanted me to work most of our whole marriage, and 
11 
then at one point in time, I started working.  I think I worked 9 years, but then he wanted me to stop 
12 
working because we were making too much money which was throwing the kids off of the hairth, 
13 
healthcare plan, so he had me stop working and then, um, and then it was always, like, oh, don't 
14 
work because, and he'd tell the kids this, too, don't work because we wanna go on vacation.  Don't 
15 
work because we go, we always go snowboarding as a family.  We were a very tight family when 
16 
it came to doing things, and he was always, like, don't work because, you know, we wanna do this, 
17 
don't work because we wanna do that, and anyways, yeah, it was soul suckers and he didn't wanna 
18 
be anywhere near us.  My daughter told her, told him that he needed help and that she, um, wanted 
19 
her dad back.  He said, you need to get another dad and then she said, I want my dad, but I don't 
20 
want my dad drunk or and high all the time, and then, um, she said, and if you don't get help, I don't 
21 
want you, um, around my kids or at my wedding because I don't want anybody that talks to me and 
22 
my sister and my mom like you do.  She's like, I'm not gonna **** I'm not gonna take it, but he 
23 
didn't hear that part.  All he heard was, like, you're not coming to my wedding, you're not gonna 
24 
see my kids, and he rolled with that.  And like, he just struggled so bad, and it's like, this last like 
25 
month he's just, mm, mental wise, he was just like all over the place.  Like, his parents came and 
26 
this last weekend, and they came and they said that they saw the same stuff that was like, one 
27 
minute he's like rational, next minutes not.  One minute he's rational, and he's calling my, my son 
28 
in Oregon, same thing on the phone.  He'd like, anger and then not and then all over the place and 
29 
my kids have video of him over this last week, was it the weekend?  Yeah, 'cause I went on a job to, 
30 
uh, Great America, 'cause I made a whole bunch of props for an ice show and I think I just jumped 
31 
time, I don't know.   
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: So – 
34 
 
35 
 
Where do you want me – 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: Earlier you said that you, that he didn't want you to work, but I believe I 
38 
heard you say that, um, when he got back 2 days later, that you left earlier in the morning for work.  
39 
So, you're working again? 
40 
 
41 
 
Yes, I went back to work. 
42 
 
43 
Detective Castellanos: You went back to work. 
44 
 
45 
 
Yes, because – 
46 

23 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
2 
 
3 
 
– he told us that we all were now in charge of all the bills **** and through our 
4 
marriage, I never saw, I never physically saw a bill in front of my face.  I never knew how much 
5 
money we had in our bank.  I never seen a bill.  He took care of it, all the finances.  I mean, I 
6 
literally know nothing about finances at all, and so we were all, like, okay, now we're scrambling 
7 
together to like pay the mortgage and – 
8 
 
9 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah, **** – 
10 
 
11 
 
– um, put, he put my, um, I was at the house, and I, all of a sudden I, when he was in 
12 
Fort Bragg, I get a phone call, and he's like, um, hey, I got PG&E on the phone.  Um, putting it in 
13 
your name.  And I was like, oh, okay.  After we had just talked about, like, communication and all 
14 
that stuff, and I was like, I would have been fine for him to do that, you know, 'cause I wanted to be 
15 
able to contribute, and I was just kinda thrown off guard because for him to be like this big, oh, we 
16 
need to like communicate more and all this stuff and to just like call me and have the other lady on 
17 
the line and I was like, I don't know what I'm doing, and she's like, so, you wanna, uh, 
18 
congratulations on your new property and you wanna like put it in your name, and I'm just like, and 
19 
then at the end of the conversation, he's like, I'll call you later and explain, so I was like, okay, well, 
20 
maybe he's got something to explain about it, and he calls me and he tells me, uh, yeah, I put your 
21 
name on there 'cause I don't know what's going on.  And I'm like, okay, and they were going back 
22 
and forth, also, him and his parents, whether they're going to sell or keep the business, 'cause he 
23 
didn't want any part of it anymore and this and that, so the first initial visit, they were gonna keep 
24 
the business, and then second visit, they were not gonna keep the business, so when he called me 
25 
with that information, he told me, and we're selling the business.  And I was like, okay, and then he 
26 
was like, so what are you doing this weekend, and I'm like, mm, I don't really have any plans.  I 
27 
know it's the fair, so the kids are probably all gonna go to the fair, and he's like, I don't wanna go to 
28 
the fair, so I think I'm just gonna stay here a little bit longer, and – 
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
So, he was still there at Labor Day? 
31 
 
32 
 
– he was still, yeah, so he was still there Labor Day, and he was living at Big River.  
33 
He was like, staying there until the, uh, I don't know if it's a warden or who is it that comes around 
34 
and make you leave the – 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: Oh, the State Park Ranger? 
37 
 
38 
 
– **** the State Park Rangers or whatever. 
39 
 
40 
Detective Castellanos: Yeah. 
41 
 
42 
 
And they'd come around.  He got a ticket one night, and he may have gotten more 
43 
than that, but um, and then he'd move, and I don't know where'd go, and then he'd come back after 
44 
they left, and then he would like that system for a while, and he was like going back and forth 
45 
between two parks, I think. 
46 

24 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so I wanna go back to – 
2 
 
3 
 
Oh, God. 
4 
 
5 
Detective Castellanos: – the incident where he came back 2 days later, then he was packing up the 
6 
stuff from the garage and then where, um, you asked him if he was going to move out, and he said 
7 
yes, and then – 
8 
 
9 
 
Yeah. 
10 
 
11 
Detective Castellanos: – he got angry.   
12 
 
13 
 
Mm hmm. 
14 
 
15 
Detective Castellanos: Can we start back from, from when you asked him that question and go on 
16 
from there?  Um, you, you had mentioned something about, um, your daughter saying that he 
17 
wasn't allowed in the wedding.  Was it that same day, too? 
18 
 
19 
 
Yeah, that was the same argument.   
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: Oh. 
22 
 
23 
 
That, that argument. 
24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
26 
 
27 
 
When I asked him if he was moving, and he like blew up, it was, it was that same 
28 
argument. 
29 
 
30 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
31 
 
32 
 
And then he was mad because I didn't, I didn't stick up for him, and say hey, that 
33 
was like uncalled for, but at the same time, I've always been, like, like, you, you, you, and I was 
34 
just like, I, my girls are adults.  If they feel like he's out of line, I feel like they can like talk for 
35 
themselves just like he was yelling at them.  I was like, I'm gonna sit back and let her, and I kinda 
36 
looked at her when she said it, but I was like, you know what, and the way she said it, too, she's 
37 
like, you need to get help.  You know, or, you know, it wasn't like, I don't want you, you know, 
38 
and, um, yeah, and then that's when he was like, you're soul suckers, and then he got in my other 
39 
daughter's face, like, really, really close.  Um, her boyfriend was on the phone when this all 
40 
happened, and she dropped it into her lap, so he heard the majority of that argument go down, and 
41 
then, um, 
 the one that, uh, said about the daughter or whatever, um, she recorded the very 
42 
last bit of it.  She was trying, like, get him, like, you know, the last, because he left and then he 
43 
came back in with the bills and stuff and, um, she caught a little bit of it, but at, **** that point, it 
44 
started to, like, deescalate a little bit. 
45 
 
46 

25 
 
Detective Castellanos: So, she was the one who told him that, he's, he wasn't gonna be allowed at 
1 
the wedding? 
2 
 
3 
 
Yeah. 
4 
 
5 
Detective Castellanos: Eh, or around – 
6 
 
7 
 
 
8 
 
9 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
10 
 
11 
 
**** yes. 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos:
  Um, so what happened after that argument.  Um, you said that it 
14 
started to, um, what was it?  Deescalate.  So, um – 
15 
 
16 
 
Yeah, he **** calmed down a little bit, went out to the RV, he was crying.  Um, I 
17 
heard him in the other room, like, mumbling to himself when he was like unhooking things.  I don't 
18 
know what he was saying.  Um, he went out to the RV and that's when he came in with some bills, 
19 
and he said, here, you know, take, what can you take care of.  I'm like, I can take care of this.  And 
20 
then he said, all right, well, I'll take of this for now.  I don't remember what bill it was, I just know 
21 
it was the, we, we said the, the mortgage and the PG&E.  Um, it may have been property insurance 
22 
or something.  I don't know.  Like I said, I, clueless to the bills.  Um, and then he would always, 
23 
too, he would like say, like, mean, mean things and then turn around be, uh, but I love you.  You 
24 
know, like **** mean, mean things and then try to hug the girls and they're just, like, you know, 
25 
you can't say these things and then just, but I love you.  You know, you're soul suckers, but I love 
26 
you.  You know, and um, but anyways, he, uh – 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: So, then after that argument, um, did he leave the house or – 
29 
 
30 
 
He left, he went out, back out to the RV, and then he left the next morning. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: So, he left the next morning. 
33 
 
34 
 
I was on my way into town and we crossed paths at the stoplight.  I was going into 
35 
work.  We crossed paths at the stoplight, I, he, at some point that day, he left.  And then – 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: So – 
38 
 
39 
 
– **** – 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: – so, the next day he left **** – 
42 
 
43 
 
– **** –  
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: – right, after that? 
46 

26 
 
 
1 
 
– I didn't hear from him for 2 months. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: Next day.  And he left to Big River? 
4 
 
5 
 
I'm assuming.  I don't know.  After he left, I don't know. 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Did, okay.  Next day, left **** – 
8 
 
9 
 
Yeah, I didn't hear from him for 2 months other than, um, a text message asking me 
10 
what bills were paid, and I said that I was just waiting on, um, one of the kids to help out with one 
11 
of 'em, and um, he asked if any other bills had came in the mail, and I said no, so far it's just be PG 
12 
and mortgage, and he said, oh, no, there's more.  There's, uh, property, um, insurance, the car 
13 
insurance and he said, I said, oh, I don't know, how, how much is that. He said it was like 1,000 
14 
plus, and I'm like, well, right now, like all I, I can take care of the, the mortgage and PG&E, and he 
15 
said okay, well, I'll take care of that for now.  And then, um, mm, was it a couple days after that, he 
16 
then messaged me because we had a cat, um, that abandoned us and went to our neighbor's for like 
17 
5 years and we ain't never seen her, and when he left, he took Levi, which is our dog, which she 
18 
was deadly scared of, and so all of a sudden, she appeared back at the house, and she was really 
19 
thin and skinny and the vets next door saw her in the parking lot and grabbed her and she's chipped 
20 
so it came back to us, and they called him, and he said, so he messaged me and said, hey, did 
 
21 
get a hold of you, something about a cat, and I said, yeah, it was Poods, um, she came home, and 
22 
then he's like, oh, well, she must be happy 'cause Levi's not, not there, and I said, yeah, she's just, 
23 
um, really old and skinny, and he said, yeah, like me.  And then that was, uh, with the laughy face, 
24 
I think, and then that was the end of that conversation.  And then I didn't hear from him until he 
25 
showed up at, um, our hah, haunted house event. 
26 
 
27 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
28 
 
29 
Other Speaker: 
So, it was basically from Labor, around Labor Day 'til like close to 
30 
Halloween ****? 
31 
 
32 
 
Uh, god I wish I had my phone ****. 
33 
 
34 
Detective Castellanos: Do you have it? 
35

37 
 
38

42 
Other Speaker:

44 
Detective Castellanos: Can you go grab it? 
45 
 
46 

27 
 
 
Yeah. 
1 
 
2 
Other Speaker:

3 
 
4 
Detective Castellanos: I'm sorry, I don't know how long this is gonna take, but we'll just get, we're 
5 
getting to it, so.

21 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah, I think, I –

24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
26 
 
27 
Other Speaker: 
Probably. 
28 
 
29 
Other Speaker: 
****. 
30 
 
31 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah, I think the kids are struggling a little bit, so – 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: If you think that's bests, yeah, that's – 
38 
 
39 
Other Speaker: 
Um, just allow them an opportunity to talk and – 
40 
 
41 
Other Speaker:

42 
 
43 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
44

Other Speaker: 
Um – 
14 
 
15 
Detective Castellanos: ****. 
16 
 
17 
Other Speaker: 
– so that sorta complicates things, um, because I was gonna do sort of a little 
18 
– 
19 
 
20 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
21 
 
22 
Other Speaker: 
– conversation, but I'm sure you don't want him to be talking – 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: No. 
25 
 
26 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah, she's the first one that we **** – 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: Yeah, we have the whole entire family we need to talk to. 
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
I was just saying if you wanna talk, if he wants to talk, maybe like a 
31 
one-on-one thing kinda outside, but not like a group – 
32 
 
33 
Other Speaker: 
They don't want me talking to him at all.  It's a, it's a **** the everything. 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah. 
36 
 
37 
 
Okay. 
38 
 
39 
Other Speaker: 
All right, I'll hang out in here, then. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.

Okay. 
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: So, um, yeah, eh, if you wanna check the dates **** – 
46 

29 
 
 
1 
 
Yeah, I can figure out dates.

Detective Castellanos: There's a couple I'm actually, um, if you're able to figure out like the first 
4 
time he left. 
5 
 
6 
 
Yeah. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: And then the ar, or the argument, like, if you have that.  Also, since you 
9 
have a cell phone here, um, would you be willing to allow us to take your cell phone and extract all 
10 
the data so we get all the text messages – 
11 
 
12 
 
Mm hmm. 
13 
 
14 
Detective Castellanos: – between you guys? 
15 
 
16 
 
Yeah.  Um, okay, so this is just recently.  **** okay, so this is when he messaged 
17 
me about the bills, so September 30th, he says, can you give me a call, um, can you give me, **** 
18 
I wish I didn't have this background, it's hard to read.  Uh, oh, which bills need to get paid, thanks.  
19 
And then I said, 
 needs to give me $400.00 for our mortgage today.  We're still working on 
20 
saving up for the 900 plus on the other bill. 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: So, ah, so, on September 30th, was the first time you heard from him after 
23 
2 months from not hearing from him? 
24

23 
 
24 
Other Speaker: 
Oh, at the bar? 
25 
 
26 
 
 Lounge, yeah, 'cause he was parking like a truck in one of the spots.  And I 
27 
don't know, I think you guys were called to that or somebody was called to that, too.  Um, but he's, 
28 
since then made mends with the guy, from what I've heard.  Um, let's see.  'Cause right here he 
29 
said, last weekend **** stuff out and was talking about 
  He's back, are you coming.  July 
30 
27th, August 21st.  Let's see.  Did you make it?  Or, trying to figure out what this is.  Oh, this must 
31 
be the, July, August. 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: 'Cause the concert you said was August 5th. 
34 
 
35 
 
Yeah, it was August 5th, so there's a space in between, so August 21st, this is, did 
36 
you make it.  So, this is when we went to the wedding.  And then, love you all.  Love you, too.  
37 
Then we talked about some gutter piece..  Um, and then – 
38 
 
39 
Detective Castellanos: So, August 21st was when you guys went to the meh, uh, uh, over to the 
40 
wedding, but that was also that same time that he left to parent, to his parents' the – 
41 
 
42 
 
Mm hmm. 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: – first time? 
45 
 
46 

33 
 
 
Mm hmm. 
1 
 
2 
Detective Castellanos: Got it, okay.  So, then that talk at the pool was sometime in aw, mid-aw, 
3 
mid-August instead of – 
4 
 
5 
 
Yeah. 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: – early August. 
8 
 
9 
 
It was, yeah, because it was, like I said, that we went to that concert and then it was 
10 
a few days after that that he had the, the big blowup and then he, like, 2 days after the big blowup, 
11 
he had all that remorse and like we had that big talk.  
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: So, it's safe to say that August 20th to 21st is when you guys hah, or 20th or 
14 
so is when – 
15 
 
16 
 
Yeah. 
17

22 
there was messages on here about that, but **** didn't. 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so – 
25 
 
26 
 
**** – 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: – sometime between August 19th and to the 21st, that's when that talk 
29 
ensued at the pool – 
30 
 
31 
 
Mm hmm. 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: – and that was after the big blowout or that – 
34 
 
35 
 
Yes. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: – big fight between, uh – 
38

20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: – 'cause he only left for a few days, then he came back, right?  With the 
22 
flowers?  Because you – 
23 
 
24 
 
I don't even know how long ****, it was a why, I think it was a week, probably. 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: You mentioned that you went up there and you visited him.  Do you – 
27 
 
28 
 
Yeah, let me see when that was.  Um, do you still need me to watch ****.  Spent 
29

Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
35 
 
36 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
37 
 
38 
 
Mm, good morning.  Oh.  So, we're trying to figure out when, we're trying to figure 
39 
out when he, uh, I'm so lost.   
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: So, the first time he left to his parents, August 21st.  Around that time.  Then 
42 
he came back – 
43 
 
44 
 
Then he came back and then he left – 
45 
 
46 

35 
 
Detective Castellanos: Five to seven days later, after that, so he came back. 
1 
 
2 
 
Yeah, so let me see.  It should be, 'cause this is when he was – 
3 
 
4 
Detective Castellanos: Or he came back set, September 5th. 
5 
 
6 
Other Speaker: 
September 5th, yeah. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: So, then the second time he left was when he left for 2 months, and you 
9 
didn't hear from him at all? 
10 
 
11 
 
Yes. 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: Correct?  Okay. 
14 
 
15 
 
Yes – 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
18

21 
Detective Castellanos: We got that clarified, ****. 
22 
 
23 
 
Mkay.   
24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: So, yeah, so he came back September 5th.  Let's go to when he left the 
26 
second time.   
27 
 
28 
 
When he, when he came back and was talking about the bal, when he brought me 
29 
flowers – 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: When he brought you flowers – 
32 
 
33 
 
– the second time, yes. 
34 
 
35 
Detective Castellanos: – and then he left.   
36 
 
37 
 
Okay. 
38 
 
39 
Detective Castellanos: Then you didn't hear from him for 2 months. 
40 
 
41 
 
I just saw that.  Stuck in traffic.  Um, ****.  This is when he, August 25th, so yes, 
42 
this is when we were at the wedding, was August 25th, that weekend.  Um, goodnight, heading 
43 
back **** a week.  So, we got back Sunday, August 27th, and he was back home.  Um – 
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: He was back home already August 27th? 
46 

36 
 
 
1 
 
Um, August 27, good morning.  Good morning.  How was the wedding?  Um, nice, 
2 
had a good time.  Good.  Are you staying 'til Monday.  No, heading home soon.  Oh, okay.  And 
3 
then when we got back, he was back, so that was August 27th.  He was already back.  I don't know 
4 
when he got back, but he was already back at the house.   
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: And that's from the first time he went to the parents', right? 
7 
 
8 
 
Yes.  And then, let's see. 
9 
 
10 
Detective Castellanos: So, how did we get that September 5th date again? 
11 
 
12 
Other Speaker: 
That was when she said he came back with the flowers **** Costco stuff. 
13 
 
14 
Detective Castellanos: But that wasn't the day **** of the parents' right, the first time? 
15 
 
16 
 
**** sorry, **** unbutton my **** – 
17 
 
18 
Other Speaker: 
No, that was – 
19 
 
20 
 
– stomach hurts. 
21 
 
22 
Other Speaker: 
****. 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: Yeah, okay.   
25 
 
26 
 
Um, let's see.  What is this.  On the road now.  Okay, drive safe.  Morning.   
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: And then you just said he, I believe you said earlier that he left to go – 
29 
 
30 
 
Tuesday – 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: – fix – 
33 
 
34 
 
– so, I think it was Tuesday, August 29th is when he went to his parents' – 
35 
 
36 
Other Speaker: 
So, for the second time. 
37 
 
38 
 
– and he also lost like extreme amount of weight during this time.  Like scary and 
39 
like I think he probably lost a good 30 plus pounds and, um, he kept telling us, and he was telling 
40 
this to his parents, too, that he's dying. 
41 
 
42 
Other Speaker: 
Mm. 
43 
 
44 
 
Yeah.  Um – 
45 
 
46 

37 
 
Other Speaker: 
But he had no medical issues that you know of. 
1 
 
2 
 
Not that I know of 'cause he would never go to the doctor, and he didn't believe in 
3 
the doctor system.  He didn't believe in any of that stuff.  He said that, he always told us that if he 
4 
got cancer, if he ever was ill in anyway, he would just ride it out and just die. 
5 
 
6 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
7 
 
8 
 
He didn't want, didn't want any help. 
9 
 
10 
Other Speaker: 
And he never tried to seek any type of mental health or anything? 
11 
 
12 
 
No.   
13 
 
14 
Other Speaker: 
'Cause he wasn't looking at it the same way you were. 
15 
 
16 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah. 
17 
 
18 
 
It's like, how do you help somebody that doesn't wanna get help. 
19 
 
20 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah, or that doesn't realize, I mean **** – 
21 
 
22 
 
Yeah, I don't know if he realized it or, I don't know.  It's like, you, someone's 
23 
drowning and you're trying to give 'em a life raft, and they don't wanna accept it.  You know, it's 
24 
like, how do you deal with that. 
25 
 
26 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah.  
27 
 
28 
 
Sorry.   
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
It's okay.   
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: **** so from, from my understanding, he left a total of three times then.  On 
33 
the 21st, then he came back the 27th, then he left back on the 29th, and then he came back 
34 
September 5th – 
35 
 
36 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
37 
 
38 
Detective Castellanos: – then he left at, or after that, too. 
39 
 
40 
 
Yeah, so he left for, during the wedding, and then he left to, yes.  The three times. 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: 'Cause he left again to go help, help plug in some computers for – 
43 
 
44 
 
Yes. 
45 
 
46 

38 
 
Detective Castellanos: – the parents, right? 
1 
 
2 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
3 
 
4 
 
After, right after the wedding yeah. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: Got it.   
7 
 
8 
 
So, he wasn't home very long between that, that time span. 
9 
 
10 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  So, now we need the date for when he left the third time, then. 
13 
 
14 
 
**** I think, I think this is gotta be it, maybe.  Good morning, Levi's with me.  We 
15 
didn't text a whole lot **** so it's like, um, ****'s in the house.  That was 9 **** Tuesday, August 
16 
29th.  Good morning.  I think this might be August 29th, Tuesday is when he went back to, uh, help 
17 
his parents. 
18 
 
19 
Detective Castellanos: All right. 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
Okay, with the computer. 
22 
 
23 
Detective Castellanos: With the computers? 
24 
 
25 
 
Yeah.  Um, 'cause he sent me a picture, a selfie, good morning.  Um, something 
26 
about the vets and Levi's medication.  Um, yeah, I think that's it, and then he's at the beach again.   
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: And that's when he's sending you the kayaking stuff and – 
29 
 
30 
 
Yes, so you got all these – 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: – **** pictures. 
33 
 
34 
 
– yeah, so you got, yeah.  Beach, beach.  Um, looks like, enjoy, wish you were here.  
35 
And sunsets.  **** at night, love you, um, **** ticket.  August 31st, it's a picture.  Trying to see 
36 
where this is.  Um, so he's still gone.  I think that's his brother's house.  That's our room.  It's colder.  
37 
Okay, so something, I don't know what happened, um, if it was something with his family down 
38 
there around this time, I think.  So, he sent me ****, uh, sent the cat.  ****.  Love you, good night.  
39 
All right, so he's at his parents house there.  Okay, so I think right here, something, I don't know 
40 
what it was, but um, he sent me this picture, good morning., and I said good morning.  He sent the 
41 
picture of a room, and I said cold and breezy this morning, and then he sends a sad face, and then I 
42 
was like 68, kinda nice, and then heartbroken. 
43 
 
44 
Other Speaker: 
What date's this? 
45 
 
46 

39 
 
 
Um, September, I think it was September 1st, if that's how this works up here, I 
1 
think. 
2 
 
3 
Other Speaker: 
Mm. 
4 
 
5 
 
Yeah – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Yeah. 
8 
 
9 
 
– September 1st. 
10 
 
11 
Other Speaker: 
Okay, ****. 
12 
 
13 
 
Um, then he sends a broken heart and then there was, and then I sent a sad face with 
14 
a kiss emoji, and then I love you.  And then I said, I miss you.  There was a time span between 12 
15 
and 3.  I said, miss you and then miss you too.  And then this is when he called to change the phone 
16 
bill over, so something that day.  I don't know what made him sad, he switched because things 
17 
were like, you know, and then all a sudden it was like the sad emojis and the heartbroken and, and 
18 
then I didn't hear from him.  Like, I messaged **** I didn't hear from him, and then that's when he 
19 
says, are you home now, and I said, I am, and then he called me.  And then I said, good night with 
20 
a heart, didn't hear from him until the morning.  And then more pictures.  Good night. Good 
21 
morning.  And this is when he's like head over if you don't have plans, so that was September 3rd 
22 
that I went and saw him. 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: So, you actually went September 3rd **** – 
25 
 
26 
 
I went and saw him at the beach and spent about 4 hours there, I wanna say. 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: Where'd you go to again? 
29 
 
30 
 
It was Big River. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: Big River.  Okay. 
33 
 
34 
 
And then that's when he says head over if you don't have plans.  Let me think about 
35 
it.  I have a few things I gotta do first if I did.  And then he said, okay, blushy faced heart, what are 
36 
your plans, and I said, just, and I said, what are you plans, just hanging at river.  **** 'til sunset, 
37 
maybe back to Van Damme, so he was going from Van Damme to Big River.  And then I said, we 
38 
obviously need to talk.  I don't know if this is something you want to do.  And then I said, there, 
39 
that is.  And then, uh, yes, that would be good if you want.  Do you wanna come here or wait 'til I 
40 
get back question mark, and I said, I don't know when or if you were, meaning I didn't know when 
41 
or if you were, meaning I didn't know when or if he was even coming home, that's what that was. 
42 
 
43 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
44 
 
45 

40 
 
 
And then, uh, I probably won't come home 'til Monday or Tuesday but can stay 
1 
longer if you come, and then I said, **** don't know what I should do, what are your thoughts, and 
2 
then he says, it would be great to see you here, but if you wanna wait, I'd understand.  And then, 
3 
that's when the, uh, okay, well, I'm coming your way, and he talked about being crowded, parking 
4 
lot, heart, peace and then, uh, love you, good night, this probably after I left, love you and good 
5 
night.  Love you, too.  Um, good night.  Moving on again, Ranger came.  I said, I made it home.  
6 
So, I got home about 10:48 that night, and then, good night, and then the next morning was more 
7 
like hearts and pictures.  Um, and then I said, looks a little different 'cause it was like bare, the 
8 
beach was bare and when I went there, it was like full of people.  I've never seen – 
9 
 
10 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
11 
 
12 
 
– that beach that full in my entire life.  It was really nice.  But this is my balance 
13 
path.  That's the log I was talking about. 
14 
 
15 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
16 
 
17 
 
And I said, not sure what that means.  Um, good night, and then he said my past and 
18 
then I took these pictures of shadows on the log, my present with more dog shadows, uh, my future 
19 
and I don't really know how to interpret that. 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
22 
 
23 
 
Um, and then the log washing up.  I'm assuming that's what it is.  It's kinda hard to 
24 
see what it is.  And then his picture, love you too.  And then he sends star see something empathy, 
25 
earth angel, you know, his, his um, stuff that he was doing, aliens and, um, good morning, and then 
26 
I think this is when he comes back, so – 
27 
 
28 
Other Speaker: 
September 5th? 
29 
 
30 
 
Yep. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: So, September 5th.   
33 
 
34 
 
And then that, he sent me the, that picture of Levi, he sent a picture of the lawn, 
35 
good morning, looks nice and do you need anything from Costco.  And then, and then it goes to 
36 
September 30th, give me a call about the bills.  So, then there was – 
37 
 
38 
Other Speaker: 
An he was already gone again? 
39 
 
40 
 
Mm hmm. 
41 
 
42 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: So, before that, um, give me a call about the bills, what was the date for the 
45 
last one? 
46 

41 
 
 
1 
 
September 5th. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: Sep – 
4 
 
5 
 
That's when he came back – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Came back. 
8 
 
9 
 
– and then that's when he like loaded the RV with all his stuff – 
10 
 
11 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
12 
 
13 
 
– and then got – 
14 
 
15 
Detective Castellanos: Oh, so – 
16 
 
17 
 
– in a fight with my daughters, and – 
18 
 
19 
Detective Castellanos: – and then he left the next day, though – 
20 
 
21 
 
– the soul suckers and – 
22 
 
23 
Detective Castellanos: – right? 
24 
 
25 
 
Yeah. 
26 
 
27 
Detective Castellanos: So, September 6th is when he left back. 
28 
 
29 
 
I think it was.  He may have been there, let's see, so he came and he unloaded.  I, I 
30 
wanted, I wanna say he was there 2 days maybe.   
31 
 
32 
Other Speaker: 
Or around the 7th? 
33 
 
34 
 
Yeah.  It coulda been 2 days.  Maybe. 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so – 
37 
 
38 
 
I don't know.   
39 
 
40 
Detective Castellanos: – September 7th, **** around that day.  Um – 
41 
 
42 
 
I feel so sick.  **** stomach hurts **** – 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: – showed up at **** why, why do I have that.  Next day left and didn't hear 
45 
from him for ****.  Oh, that's where we're at.  So, he showed up at the Halloween event. 
46 

42 
 
 
1 
 
Yeah. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: What day was that? 
4 
 
5 
 
It was our last event.  Um, which was, oh, I don't think we talked much after that 
6 
other than he was.  Oh, wait, hang on.  Um, let's see.  So, September 30th, we talked about the – 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: The bill – 
9 
 
10 
 
– bills and then October 1st, is when he messaged me about our cat.  About the vets 
11 
messaging him and then, uh, she came by the other day.  It's Poods.  She's home.  She's skinny and 
12 
old.  Wow, me too.  Probably happy Levi is not around.  Um, and she's been staying **** back and 
13 
forth, and then he **** smiley face.  And then October 1st, and then it went to November 4th was 
14 
the next text message that we had.  And then, our event night was, oh, I'm trying to think.  It was 
15 
20, let's see.  Let me look at my calendar.  Oh, my god.  So, 31st, so it was the 29th.   
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: So, he came back the 20 – 
18 
 
19 
 
He was in town – 
20 
 
21 
Detective Castellanos: – **** – 
22 
 
23 
 
– prior to that, though, 'cause he parked his RV behind his office, but he never, like, 
24 
talked to us or reached out until the, wait, maybe it was not, yeah, it was the 29th.  No, sorry, 28th, 
25 
the 29th was Sunday, and we didn't do it on Sunday, so yeah, the 28th, sorry.   
26 
 
27 
Detective Castellanos: So, did he showed up at the Halloween event or did he show up at the 
28 
house? 
29 
 
30 
 
He showed up at the, the Halloween event. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: **** – 
33 
 
34 
Other Speaker: 
The Haunted Lake County. 
35 
 
36 
 
Um, Haunted Lake County, um – 
37 
 
38 
Detective Castellanos: At the corn maze? 
39 
 
40 
 
Mm – 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: Off of – 
43 
 
44 
 
– no, the actual haunt itself that was downtown. 
45 
 
46 

43 
 
Detective Castellanos: Where is that? 
1 
 
2 
Other Speaker: 
Old **** bank. 
3 
 
4 
 
The old Bank of America building. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: Oh, okay, got it.  **** – 
7 
 
8 
 
Yeah, um, and he showed up there on our event night and um, I instantly got like 
9 
upset **** 'cause like I said, we've just been struggling, not knowing, we haven't heard from him 
10 
in like 2 months and we like, the last he left, was like, he didn't wanna ever see us again.  He wasn't 
11 
gonna come home and we were all, had to take care of all the bills, and so I'd been dealing with, 
12 
like, going to work and crying at work, and going to the haunt and crying at the haunt, and – 
13 
 
14 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
15 
 
16 
 
–it was just like a anxiety was kicking in.  I was like, sick and he shows up at the, 
17 
like, at the haunt, and it was like right before our event, and I'm **** in my full makeup and I'm 
18 
trying not to cry 'cause I didn't want my makeup to run, and, and then my son surprised me that 
19 
night from Oregon, which was really nice, and they, they had, they said they had a good visit with 
20 
him for like 2 hours, um, before they, before they came through the haunt.  They visited with, uh, I 
21 
don't know really how that, how, how that went, but they said that it was about 2 hours that they 
22 
talked to him when he was parked behind his office.  **** um, but it was like bringing me a lot of 
23 
anxiety having him there, and I was like, trying to hold it on the job and trying to, like, work at the 
24 
haunted house, and I had, and on top of that, I was making props for Great America Ice Show, and 
25 
I was like, really extremely overwhelmed, and then he showed up and my anxiety was like through 
26 
the roof, and um, he told the kids that he didn't feel welcome at the house, so he was gonna stay, 
27 
um, behind the office, and then we had the corn maze on the Sunday, the following Sunday, and 
28 
when we got back from the corn maze, he was in the RV in the driveway.  Um, I don't think we saw 
29 
him that night 'til the next day, and then he **** 'cause it was late, and he didn't come out, um, and 
30 
then the next day, he talked to my oldest son, um, outside for a, quite a few hours, I wanna say.  
31 
Like, 6 hours, and he was talking about how he wanted to, um, make our property a nonprofit, 
32 
whether it be a church or, um, a trailer park and invite all these people that he's met on his road trips 
33 
to come stay, um, and all these hookups and stuff, but last he left, he didn't wanna be, de, be with 
34 
us, you know, he was like, so when my son came and told me that, I'm like, one minute he doesn't 
35 
wanna be with us, we're soul suckers and he hates our guts, and then now he's back and he's gonna 
36 
turn it into a trailer park and a nonprofit church or something.  He was, eh, some religions that, he 
37 
was like taking bits and pieces of these religions and, I don't know, it just seems like things started, 
38 
like, getting a little wacky.  Like, not making a lot of sense.  Um, yeah, he was just tall, eh, I 
39 
watched him like walk around the property, and he was just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and my son, I 
40 
mean, from what I could see, didn't have, like, much word in, he was just very like high on, like, 
41 
whatever it was that he was excited about.  Um, and then, uh, the next day, our, our event night 
42 
went really well at the, at the corn maze.  More, it was busier than we thought it was gonna be, and 
43 
we were understaffed, so we needed to start pulling people to, like, fill in, and I'm like trying to like 
44 
recruit people and get costumes and running back from the house to there, and he's there, and I, like 
45 
I said, there was just like anxiety and nerves and not knowing and I didn't have time to sit and talk 
46 

44 
 
with him, 'cause there was just so much going on, and I was just, it was just wrong time for him to 
1 
like be there, and I get to the house, and he's talking about how I should have the Haunted Lake 
2 
County like park, um, storage units on our property and charge them to help pay for the mortgage, 
3 
and at the time, we haven't even talked about what our relationship looks like.  I haven't heard from 
4 
you, like, in 2 months, and you're talking stuff that we haven't even discussed, and so I was just 
5 
overwhelmed, and I was just like, I don't know if gonna even be here, and that was it, the words 
6 
that I said.  I walked into my room, and he had been packing his belongings from our closet, and it 
7 
was like, all over our room, and it was like, on a normal day, that would be stressful for somebody, 
8 
like, to come home and see your husband, like, leaving, and like, packing all his stuff, and it was 
9 
like, so much for me.  I had like a little nervous breakdown, and he, he came in there, and I like, 
10 
like, walked in there, and I'm like, can you please not do this right now, and he's like aw, I'll get it 
11 
outta your way, have a good night tonight, and I was like trying to calm myself, and he didn't see 
12 
him, like, upset or anything.  It wasn't until he left, and I walked out and my son was like, all he 
13 
said was like two words, and I was like, you don't understand, like, I am going through so much 
14 
right now, it's like, I'm losing my best friend.  I'm losing my husband and my family's falling apart.  
15 
I don't know if I'm gonna be here.  I don't know if this, I'm gonna have a home.  I'm trying to work 
16 
to support my family now because he's thrown all the bills on us, and I'm like juggling like, uh, 
17 
multiple things all at once.  I was like, I'm like, have you even seen my room, and he's like no, and 
18 
then he went and looked, and he saw that, like, he had like started moving stuff out, and I'm like, 
19 
that on a normal person's breakup would be enough to like 'cause them any, like, stress and 
20 
whatnot, and um, so anyways, also, on his journey, which I'm glad, and I told him, I'm like, I'm 
21 
happy that, 'cause he at least loved music and he started playing music again, and he, he wrote a 
22 
song for the kids and, and he was connecting with friends that he used to play music with and it 
23 
was everything that I always wanted him to do and like he had a friend reach out, like, um, weeks 
24 
prior to that.  It was his birthday, and I like messaged him.  I'm like, hey, happy birthday, and he's 
25 
like, oh, hey, I haven't heard from you guys in a while, how's Rick, I'd really like to touch bases 
26 
with him.  And ah, and this is like before all this happened, and I was like, um, oh, we're pretty 
27 
good.  He's like, I live down in Shasta.  I'm like, oh, we go snowboarding up there a lot.  He's like, 
28 
I'd love to go snowboarding with you guys and meet up, give me his number, and I knew that Rick 
29 
probably didn't want to like connect, so I didn't wanna give him his, like, cell phone, so I said, hey, 
30 
you could reach him at the office, which probably would be the safest way 'cause then I'm not 
31 
giving his number out. 
32 
 
33 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
34 
 
35 
 
And, um, when he got home, I, I mentioned it to him, I said, hey, Mike Ellers, like, 
36 
reached out, and he's like wants to talk to you or whatever and see how things are going.  He said 
37 
that he's living in Shasta, and he's like, I don't wanna talk to anybody from my past.  He's like, that's 
38 
just what I do.  Like, I, I get connections and then I move on.  He's like, I did that in college and I do 
39 
that with them and then just moving on.  And kinda got in a little tiff.  It wasn't like bad, but it was 
40 
an argument because I was just like, I know this is what you need.  I know you need to be around 
41 
friends and you know, and stuff, and he, family, and just people who love you, and he was just not 
42 
about it.  He does not wanna be anywhere near people and he ****.  It's tough 'cause every day you 
43 
hear like negative, negative, negative, negative.   
44 
 
45 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
46 

45 
 
 
1 
 
It's like, I just want my husband to come home and just be happy to see us not be 
2 
like, you know, I hate this person and I hate the guy next door and if I was to kill somebody, I'd kill 
3 
him or just so negative all the time that it starts taking a tole on all of us.  I mean, we're all like, I 
4 
just want, I just wanted him to be happy, and I just wanted everybody to be happy and we all knew 
5 
that he was, like, struggling.  It's just, this last little bit was just get, getting worse, and the, him 
6 
getting so thin and just saying that he was dying and.  Oh, God, I can't believe he's actually gone.   
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Well, you're doing a great job with giving us a lot of details about – 
9 
 
10 
 
Oh, God. 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: – your guys' relationship, and everything.  I know it's al, a lot to handle right 
13 
now, but we appreciate it.  And like I said, if you need a break at any point in time, just let us know.  
14 
Um – 
15 
 
16 
 
I just gotta, like, get it over with.  ****. 
17 
 
18 
Detective Castellanos: So, you mentioned him coming back October 28th, and then – 
19 
 
20 
 
So, he came for the event – 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: – the event and the – 
23 
 
24 
 
– and my daughter gave him a tour through.  It wasn't like during haunt hours.  It 
25 
was just, she gave him a tour.  Um, he asked if he could barrow one of their cars because he had a 
26 
whole bunch of stuff delivered to the house under Levi's friend, which Levi is our dog, and it was 
27 
under Levi's friend, and um, it was a whole bunch of like probably $9,000.00 worth of speakers, 
28 
like, music equipment.  Um, big, huge, like, speakers that each one of 'em, there was like three of 
29 
'em, and then he had more show up that I didn't even see.  Those were, they were like 1,000 bucks 
30 
a piece.  And for him to say that we, you know, didn't have money and, and all this stuff, and him 
31 
from spending like that, was kind of like, here we're struggling to like pay the bills, but you could 
32 
just, you know, spend that much money on, that we don't have, it just didn't make a lot of sense.  
33 
Um, but uh, my daughter was like, now I know why he came home.  And she's like, he has a whole 
34 
bunch of stuff here that got delivered and is like, she's like, he didn't come home to see us, he came 
35 
home to get his stuff.  And um, so anyways, he was at the house **** he started, like, we had like 
36 
a whole bunch of lattice on the side of the garage, and he started, like, attaching it like setting it up 
37 
around the edges of the RV. 
38 
 
39 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
40 
 
41 
 
And um, someone had said that, in a conversation, that he wanted to make the RV 
42 
like six-wheel drive and, like, build a, a deck on it up top and turn it into a mobile stage and, um, he 
43 
was gonna do something with the sides of it to make it look better.  I don't know, so, I was thinking, 
44 
well, maybe he's trying to think it out the lattice or something, but then it became permanent.  He 
45 
like strapped it down, started, I mean, it, it started to look like a homeless encampment there for a 
46 

46 
 
bit.  Um, but he was, one night, cleaning out the garage, and we have a detached garage that our 
1 
boat usually goes in, so I thought maybe he, when he came back, 'cause he, when he came back, he 
2 
was like, hey, I wanna show one of the kids how to back flush the pool.  You know, like, he was 
3 
planning to like go again.  You know, and like, teaching us certain things that need to be done 
4 
around the house, and um, he showed 
 how to back flush the pool and, and then he said he 
5 
got, was starting to get frustrated down there with something and he was able to like calm himself 
6 
down. 
7 
 
8 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
9 
 
10 
 
And he was like, see, patience, and then he like, um, unhooked the **** maker and 
11 
the, and he was like, see, if you just calm down, or something, he said to my son, I don't know, but 
12 
um, 'cause he was really focusing on that.  Like, trying not to have outbursts and live more in the 
13 
moment and be nice to people. 
14 
 
15 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
16 
 
17 
 
**** when I went and visited him on the beach, he was talking about that, like, how 
18 
he was like, Levi was like his connection with people.  If Levi walked up to somebody and was, 
19 
and like greeted him nicely, he knew those people were nice people – 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
Hmm. 
22 
 
23 
 
– and that's how he was meeting people, and he was like, you know, trying to see 
24 
the good in people, because he was so negative all the time.  So, I know that that was a part of his 
25 
journey where he was trying to be like nicer. 
26 
 
27 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
28 
 
29 
 
And I could see he was trying, could see he was trying, I could see it, but he was 
30 
still like lost.  He was still lost, and then coming back, looking that thin and then telling us that he's 
31 
dying and he was cleaning out the garage, and I like went out there to see if he was like gonna 
32 
move the boat in there, and he said, no, I'm gonna clean it out and I'm going to, um, live in it and 
33 
park the RV there and this and that, but like I said, we had, hadn't even had time to even talk about, 
34 
like, what our future looked like 'cause the last conversation we had, he didn't want any part of us.  
35 
And so, I told him that, um, him being there, that was cause, that I didn't appreciate him like 
36 
showing up unannounced, especially when you're talking about communication.  I'm like, how 
37 
could, why couldn't you have just said, hey, I know I haven't talked in a bit, but, um, would it be 
38 
okay if I came and saw the haunted house and like, you know, saw what you did 'cause I know that 
39 
he was always like proud of me **** proud of me there and in years past he was always a part of it, 
40 
so we knew that it woulda just been, instead of just showing up, you know, I said, I'm like, can you 
41 
just like been more open and just said, hey, I know that I left and I needed time to heal, but I don't 
42 
know if, like, you've gotten that healing yet 'cause that was one of his things, he was like, I want 
43 
you to take your time to heal, and heal with you have, what you need, and he kept trying to tell me 
44 
that I had like childhood trauma and stuff, and I'm like, I needed to heal from the moments that he 
45 

OAAINDUNHWNe

like had these outbursts, and like over the years of just the mental abuse that he did, that was my
healing, is like I needed that time to like figure out if like, is he my person, you know.

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

Or was it just the kids that kept us together so long. I don't know. I know that I
loved him. I loved him a lot, and then I missed him like crazy, but I didn't know if that was like
right, still made it right, you know. But anyways, I like, I was out there, and he started getting
irate, and yelling and stuff, and um, I just finally, he just like yelled, and he said, just get out of my
face, just get outta my face, and then I left, and um, I came into the house, and then, uh, I'm trying
to think, like, after that, and then it just kinda got worse after that, where he, he had all this stuff out
of the garage, and he started piling it around the RV. In that garage, he has plenty of room, there's
no reason to have any of that stuff. Like, the RV's looked, like, the kids saw it. I didn't, didn't see
it, but it looked like a hoarder was in there, and there was plenty of room for that stuff in the
garage. There was no reason to have it, like, out or like living like that. 'Cause there's been nights
that, you know, he stayed in that RV many of times. Like, he'd go drink and he'd never come in the
house. He'd just go straight to the RV, and he'd stay in it, and I didn't hear from him 'til the
morning. There was no reason to live. There's no reason to live like that. Um, but it just started
progressingly, you know, starting to get worse and worse and worse, and um, when he, uh, one of
the days he hooked up the stereo system he got, and he had it really, really loud, and it was the
night that my son left, and everybody left after **** and I just, and he **** still like, and he had
that music so loud that me and my daughter, um, went to my friend's house ‘cause I was still
working on these, um, props. I'm like, I can't even think, can't hear the TV and the neighbor was
yelling.

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

and I was just like, I can't, and so we just packed up and went to my, um, my bosses
house for a few hours. And then came back, but um, across the street, was getting
concerned. Um, my neighbor down the way, who they hated each other, um, at one point, Rick,
my husband, Rick, his other, the neighbor's but um, almost went at it in the front yard,
‘cause my son getting married, and we were watering the lawn, and um, | | came over and said,
hey, are you gonna be doing that all summer and with the drought and duh, duh, duh, and then my
husband, Rick was like, get off my fucking property and duh, duh, duh, duh, and started yelling at
him, and then, um, they were like sending, like, papers back and forth, dropping off **** about
water conservation and whatnot, but they just did not like each other, and I get a message from
down the road saying, hey, um, can I talk to Rick, I think I can help him, and I was like, um,
well, he's all about, like, trying to like find peace with people and like, you know, make mends
‘cause like with Lounge, he like made mends with that guy, so I was like, I don't know how
he'll react. Um, I have **** actually, I screenshotted that messaged. I have that. Um, and uh, he
said, and is on meth or on drugs, and I was like, I don't know, a midlife crises or something. I, I
don't know what's going on with him, and then, um, ae. across the street, said that, um,
he'd been kinda watching him, and he stopped me and my daughter one night coming home, and
he's like, are you guys okay, and I'm like, and he's like, it doesn't look good. And I'm like, no, it
doesn't. And, um, he's like, if you ever need us, just let me know. And I'm like, okay, but then,
with the haunt stuff that was going on, I, um, I let them, like, store their trailers on our property,

 

 

47

OMAANDMNFLWNe

and um, because they all live in Santa Rosa, and it was just like being nice, you know, just, just let
‘em like, let them have the stuff on the property, and um, their son, who, uh, the guy, the ****

, the founder of, um, the haunted house, their son, | | I mean, we've been with
these people for 10 plus years. We've been doing the haunt with them. They're like family, you
know. And was coming and staying during the event night's. He's 24, and I had him, let him
stay at the house, um, this last week during cleanup, after the event, so that he's not driving back
and forth, and his car actually literally broke down and couldn't get it started in our, our driveway,
so I'm like, just stay here. Um, I went to, uh, Great America with my son, to drop off the,
the things that I built, and I get a phone call halfway coming back from, uh, my guest, from
the haunt, saying, hey, Rick just went off on me. He, um, asked me if I was paying rent, and he's
like, oh, no, you know, I just, like, said, oh, no, it's haunt season. You know —

   
 
  

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

— we basically live at the haunted house during haunt season, kinda jokingly, and
he's like, are you retarded or something, and, and was like, no, and he was like, well, you
must be 'cause, um, you're not listening and then, has really bad anxiety, so he walked back in
the house, and I'm just getting this from my daughter, but um, walked back in the house and he was
trembling, and is like, what the fuck is going on, and he's like, oh, Rick just went off on me,
asking me if I was paying rent, told me I was retarded, so then went out and confronted Rick
and then Rick I got, I guess, got in her face and, um, started screaming and yelling at her and then
he was calling, um, like a faggot and worthless, a piece of shit, nobody wants you there, just
horrible things to and um, at one point ij called me, and like, I could hear Rick yelling in
the background, and he's like, from now on in, he's like, nobody parks on this property unless
they're paying rent. And in the years past, we had let them park on our property.

 
   
 

 
  
  

 

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

reer He wasn't home for 2 months, and it's like I didn't feel the need that I needed to
reach out and ask him if, for permission. I mean, I live there, too. And, um, and so, uh, goes
to work **** after that, and then I went on with my day, and I, and about 5:00, which I knew was
robably, if anything was gonna happen again, it's gonna be around the time the kids got home, and
messages me a picture of my, my truck and our boat blocking the driveway so none of the
kids could get into our driveway.

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

And um, he said to them that he, well, uh, he lied a couple times, apparently. He
said that he was moving the boat and then it got stuck and he needs a pin to release it, so it's gotta
sit there because the pin was in with me in my car, but then a little bit later con, confessed and said
that he pulled it there, um, to block Haunted Lake County from getting the trailers.

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

  

Um, and that they owe him rent, and they owe us thousands of dollars for us helping
out over the last years that we helped there, and it's like, um, so a stayed at her boyfriend's

48

49 
 
house that night.  Um, see, I don't know.  See, I'm just getting, this is all gonna be, like, you're 
1 
gonna get this from the kids, 'cause it was just like bits and pieces that I was hearing. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: So, let's just stick with what you know and what you saw, okay. 
4 
 
5 
 
Okay – 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: **** – 
8 
 
9 
 
– and so, what I heard was just bits and pieces from the kids, but then I came home 
10 
on, um, Friday, me and 
 showed up, uh, Friday night about 10:30 – 
11 
 
12 
Other Speaker: 
Like, this last Friday. 
13 
 
14 
 
This last Friday. 
15 
 
16 
Other Speaker: 
Okay. 
17 
 
18 
 
And, um, I didn't know what I was coming home to because I, it didn't go good with 
19 
the kids – 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
22 
 
23 
 
– while I was gone, and um, I didn't know what I was coming home to, so I was 
24 
kinda scared to come home.   
25 
 
26 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
27 
 
28 
 
Um, 'cause he even, like, at one point, um, the house was locked.  He moved our, 
29 
our hide a key, um, he told my older kids that he had moved it, but he didn't tell my daughters and 
30 
I that he moved it, and so my daughter was locked out, and he was in the hot tub and didn't feel like 
31 
getting out to let her in the house 'cause the keys were in the RV, so she had to get my daughter to 
32 
come and so there was like a lot of stuff that was going on.  Uh, my daughter had to like sneak her 
33 
car out of the side gate **** – 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
**** 
 
36 
 
37 
 
Yeah. 
38 
 
39 
Other Speaker: 
 okay. 
40 
 
41 
 
All this went down, like, like eh, when I was gone, but anyways.  I got home about 
42 
10:30.  Me and 
 show up, and he's in the MINI Cooper, um, leaving, and I walk by, and he 
43 
rolls the window down and he says, hey, um, the boats parked there 'cause I was moving it, blah, 
44 
blah, blah, I need the pin.  It's in the Suburban.  I'll fix it tonight or I'll fix it, um, in the morning.  
45 
Um, I'm going out.  And I was like, okay.  And so, I went in the house, but after hearing what he 
46 

50 
 
said with the kids and everything, I was scared that night.  I was pretty scared.  Um, me and my 
1 
daughter slept in my room, and I like, put a bar on the door 'cause I didn't know, like, and hearing, 
2 
like, what they said and they like, and they actually have some video of it. 
3 
 
4 
Detective Castellanos: What did they say? 
5 
 
6 
 
They said that, um, he said that if anybody came on the property that he has, um, 
7 
poisons and gases and he'll set booby traps, and um, not to call the fire department 'causes will kill 
8 
them, um, he said that, um, me and my daughter, 
 are witches and, um, that, uh, he said that 
9 
I was not his person and that he said that I am like a CNN channel, and that I feed all the kids all 
10 
this information, and I'm like CNN channel, um, giving 'em false information.  Um, and that, uh, I 
11 
beat him and that he never like put a finger on me unless he put his hands up to like to protect his, 
12 
protect my blows or something.  I've never hit that man other than one time, I accidentally head 
13 
butt him in the dark because he was drunk and intoxicated on whatever, I don't know, it was over 
14 
this last Thanksgiving, and I went to bed early 'cause I had a really bad headache, and I was in bed.  
15 
He came in hours later wanting to have sex, and I told him no, that I wasn't feeling good, and 
16 
obviously wasn't going to when he's in that mode, and he instantly starts popping off, telling me 
17 
that I'm cheating, that I'm a fucking whore and we had, Thanksgiving, we dress up every year, and 
18 
so I had a costume.  It was, um, from Something About Mary, the gal that **** the poops.  And 
19 
that was my costume.  And he said, you walking around all night long, your fucking whore, with 
20 
your tits hanging out, and I had enough, and he was laying next to me, and I like rolled over, and I 
21 
got on top of him, and I was just like, you need to stop, and when I did that, I hit, something, I don't 
22 
even know what I hit, and I got, gave myself a bloody nose, but all the kids heard it, they run in, his 
23 
brother, my son, we had a house full, full of guests.  We have multiple witnesses of it all.  He had a 
24 
mental breakdown in there.  He, **** like, telling his brother, his brother's daughter went through 
25 
chemo, and he was telling his daw, his brother that they poisoned her with the chemo, you know, 
26 
and was talking all, again, about Carson, who passed away, and how he **** wanted to go with 
27 
him.  He was talking about his gun, tried to get it out, and they were like, no, no, no, no, I could, 
28 
you know, I could hear it **** from outside the door.  Um, they were in there for a good couple 
29 
hours, and my, my son, 
 and his brother, Jake, um, I know I got off timelines there, but – 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: No, that's okay. 
32 
 
33 
 
– but that was the only and ever a time that I accidentally may have hurt him, but – 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
36 
 
37 
 
– he didn't remember any of it in the morning.  None of it.  And he felt very 
38 
remorseful about it, 'cause when I told him the things that he said, **** I literally fell to my knees, 
39 
'cause I was like, **** saying those things to your wife, and he just like, I'm sorry, you know, he 
40 
was like, shaking his head, he didn't remember any of it.  And he had, um, another episode where 
41 
he couldn't remember, um, and got in a fight with my son's, one of my son's best friends about 
42 
turning music up, an it's my house, and, and then my oldest son and the, the friend that he got in a 
43 
fight with found him laying in the driveway, like, incoherent.  Like, they said that he, they heard a 
44 
thunk, and he was laying in the rocks, and his eyes were rolling back in his head and, um, my 
45 
youngest son had to like, and his friend had to like carrying him into bed and – 
46 

OMAANDMNFLWNe

Other Speaker: When was that?
me
Other Speaker: Approximately.

| It was right before my son's, I wanna say it was May of this, of last year.
Other Speaker: Got it.

Um, I think it was my son, he came up because heh, his friend, for the first time we
met him, I think it was his birthday party or we, it was like a day before his bachelor party for their
wedding or suh —

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

— **** yeah, I can't really remember exactly, but um, yeah, that was another big
episode that happened in front of all the kids and they were all, I was in bed. I was sleeping. I
didn't know any of this went down.

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.
| Until I heard them like say, sorry, and they were bringing him to bed.
Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

Um, oh, my god. I can't believe it. Um, but yeah, he said that I was like the **** or
whatever, and he, I think he said something to about like just get a gun and a bullet
already. Just do it. Um, according to e like, was in this conversation with him, he said
that he had it out for me and my daughter, like, he was like, he's got hate, and I was like, but in the
video, you could hear him, and he sounds very, like, sad and like sporadic and he like jumped
around a lot.

 
 
 

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

a Um, and the weird thing my daughters were saying is that he was like, yelling, like,
top of his,

, like, lungs, and then, um, I can't **** um, my son showed up and he changed his
demeanor. He was like, all, oh, it's okay, Levi, here now. And my girls always said that
‘cause they're like all, why is he like one way with us and but not all the time with, you know, he's
always, like —

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

  

— back and forth all the time. Um, fuck. I'm sorry. It's like, talking to you guys, it's
like distracting me from reality, and then I think about it, and then like, I don't know what I'm

51

52 
 
gonna do.  So, anyways, yeah, and that was like pretty much, um, uh, so I got home.  He said he 
1 
was going out.  He said that the pin was in the truck and that's why he didn't move the car.  I just 
2 
went with that because I didn't wanna escalate anything, and I thought, I just wanna get in the 
3 
house, and then me and my daughter slept in my bed, and I like have like a bar, I wedged it in the 
4 
door.  Um, the next morning, I got up, 'cause we were gonna go to the haunted house, and the guys 
5 
in the haunted house told us to not worry about the, the trailers 'cause they have backup plans, and 
6 
they wanted to focus on us 'cause they were really worried about Rick's mental health 'cause they'd 
7 
seen him a few times coming and going, dropping off the trailers, and they were really concerned.  
8 
Um, just by the look of him, from what they've known him, and just the conversations they had, 
9 
they said he was just kinda like not really there, kind of talking fantasy, non, I, I don't know, but, 
10 
um, so anyways, so me and my daughter were getting ready to leave, and we were just, had a friend 
11 
come to pick us up because my car is the truck, and it was now blocking the driveway and he's got 
12 
the keys, and um, the Suburban is our business car, and we were in the middle of trying to figure 
13 
out, like, if we're gonna sell it or not, and I, I had low gas and I had no money, so, I just had one of 
14 
the gals from the haunt come pick us up, and um, I get a phone call from 
 whose trailer is on 
15 
the property, and he's like, hey, the trailers fell through.  We really need the trailers.  Um, can I, uh, 
16 
talk to Rick.  I'm will to like work with him, but I'm telling you, that if he doesn't, I'm gonna have 
17 
to call authorities.  And I knew it wasn't gonna go good 'cause there's no talking to him at all and 
18 
they get there, and they were yelling, hey, Rick, you know, can you move your blah, blah, blah, 
19 
and he wasn't answering, so I went to the door, and I had the keys, and I knocked, and I said, hey, 
20 
um, I got the suburban keys, do you wanna get that pin so you can move the trailer, and he was like, 
21 
oh, yeah.  And then, he goes to close the door, and then he opens it and he's like, uh, you know 
22 
what, I'm busy, and I was like, well, we kinda need the trailers, and he's like, uh, closed the door 
23 
again, and opens it again and the at this point, he's like yelling, and he's like, you can fuck off, they 
24 
can fuck off, get off my fucking property.  They owe us thousands of dollars, blah, blah, blah, 
25 
they're parked on my property.  And whatever, for free and who knows, but didn't make a whole lot 
26 
of sense to me, but uh, at that time, I knew that they were gonna call the sheriff, and um, or yeah, I 
27 
guess it was the sheriff, but I knew 
 lived across the street, and he had already, like, 
28 
was concerned and so I like wanted to have somebody mediate, kind of, so I went over to 
 and 
29 
kinda said, hey, this is what's going on.  They're gonna call but I don't know what to do and, um, 
30 
that's when he said, well, does he have firearm, and I said, I know he has one in there, and my 
31 
daughter was standing right there, and she said, yeah, and last night, he said that he has these 
32 
poisons and booby traps and that he's not afraid to like use them and all this stuff, so then, 
 
33 
was like, okay, well, you need to make sure that they know so that they don't get ambushed and not 
34 
know.  God, I thought that was my worst day. 
35 
 
36 
Other Speaker: 
And that was Saturday.   
37 
 
38 
 
Yeah. 
39 
 
40 
Detective Castellanos: That's this last Saturday? 
41 
 
42 
 
Yeah.  Um, so they tried to talk him into like moving it, and he wouldn't do it, and 
43 
um, they talk about, like, towing the truck, but I was like, well, it's my truck, we're gonna, he'll just 
44 
move it back, and then they're like, well, is there another way to get on the property, and I said, 
45 
yeah, there's a gate but he put a lock on it 'cause my daughter used it the other day, and he was like, 
46 

53 
 
oh, you show me my, my, uh, faults and it's locked now or something.  And, um, and they said, 
1 
well, we have a cutter, and that's when my son was like, I'll cut it, and my two boys went and cut it, 
2 
and he like ran out, and he was like, you guys are betraying me, to the boys and that they can't 
3 
come on the property, the, the people can't come on the property, and um, that's when the sheriff 
4 
department said, well, you're wife gave them the permission, and, and then that's when he was like 
5 
saying how, like, I told him to like leave and live on the streets and be homeless and all this stuff, 
6 
which is not the case at all.  He left on his own and said bad things when he left.  It was his 
7 
decision.  It was not my decision to make.  **** decision.  My kids were telling him that they didn't 
8 
want him to leave, and that they wanted their dad back, and he said that you need to get a new one.  
9 
And then he was videotaping, he was videotaping, um, them leaving, and he's like, you're gonna be 
10 
on Channel 2 news and Haunted Lake County's gonna go down, and he's like saying all this stuff 
11 
and, and meanwhile, we had called his parents, and his parents came, 'cause 
 was hoping that 
12 
they might be able to like talk him into, like, you know, but they came from Fort Bragg, so it was a 
13 
ways away, and by the time they got there, it had already done and – 
14 
 
15 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
16 
 
17 
 
– it had **** it's thing, and uh, they came in and we like, kind of like talked and 
18 
they, we all kind of agreed that he's suffering from something, mental health something, whether 
19 
it's bipolar or I mean, we even though maybe, like, um, a tumor.  I mean, I've had the guy from 
20 
Haunted Lake County, he's a nurse in Santa Rosa, and he said that that's what his guess would have 
21 
been, something like that, a bleed, um, he was naming off all kinds of things, but **** sucks 
22 
because he's always just said how much he hates life and to hear that all time, it starts to take a toll 
23 
on somebody, 'cause you feel like you can't ever make that person happy.  This is my worst fear, 
24 
too.  It's like, I kept trying to tell myself **** 'cause he would always say he wouldn't do it, and I 
25 
kept telling myself, no, he wouldn't do that to us.  He wouldn't do it to his kids.  So, his parents 
26 
visited, but they never went out to talk to him, 'cause they knew he was irrational and it wouldn't 
27 
get anywhere, and so they left and then, um, he had sent a message to all of us about how he doesn't 
28 
wanna speak to any of us anymore during that episode, um, I don't wanna speak to any of you ever 
29 
again, and that he's, he's staying on the property.  He's not leaving and that we all can fucking 
30 
leave, and, um, that was, um, yeah, that was on Saturday.  And so, my birthday came around on 
31 
Monday.  Sunday, we went to the haunted house.  My birthday was on Monday, and he messaged 
32 
me and said, happy birthday, like, in the evening, and I said, thank you, and he said I left something 
33 
for you on the porch ****.  It was like a houseplant and a card, and a houseplant and a card that 
34 
said, um, happy birthday.  Sorry, things didn't work out, um, I will always be here for you, and I 
35 
really do love you.  And then, love, Rick.  And I, I told him, thank you and that was pretty much the 
36 
last time that we talked on text message, I think.  And last night, um, I was at work yesterday, and 
37 
I got home, and my daughter kinda messaged, uh, mentioned the fact that our dog was outside all 
38 
day, and usually the dog's by his side 24/7, and uh, yeah, that's kinda weird **** and, and we all 
39 
kinda like were like kinda worried, but then I saw, like, um, movement in the trailer, so I was like, 
40 
okay, so he musta just been sleeping, and then, um, I had messaged my son, and I said, hey, did you 
41 
see dad tonight, and, and he said no, I, um, haven't talked to him or seen him since the event, which 
42 
was the, when the sheriff showed up.   
43 
 
44 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
45 
 
46 

54 
 
 
And, um, so last night, I went to bed about midnight, and I woke up at 2:00 in the 
1 
morning to, um, loud music.  He was playing music down by the pool.  He had pulled a speaker 
2 
down there and he was playing it loud enough to where I had earplugs in, pillow over my head.  I 
3 
had like my, my app going that like has like the white noise just to try to muffle, like, the thum, 
4 
boom, boom and – 
5 
 
6 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
7 
 
8 
 
– boom, um, and that was like 2:00 in the morning, and then at 3:00, he messaged 
9 
us all, um, oh, my gosh, with the group chat, and he said, I will not communicate further with 
10 
anyone until I see all unenclosed legal files on me including the most recent encounter where you 
11 
called the sheriff, which we told him it wasn't us, um, including written, verbal, gossip, 
12 
handwriting, notes, video, audio, drone, bio, any other surveillance tracking including A-I, past, 
13 
current, future methods, file F-O-I-A, I don't know what that is.  Um, and then, uh, that was at 3 in 
14 
the morning.  And then my daughter in the morning said just to clarify, we didn't involve the 
15 
police.  Haunted Lake County took that step because they didn't have any, have a choice. 
16 
 
17 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
18 
 
19 
 
Um, I left for work.  My daughter left for, uh, we all left for work.  My son was at a 
20 
friend's house, and I don't know when he got home, but when I got off work, my daughter, 
 
21 
messaged, or called me and said, hey, I'm on my lunch break, are you at Hallmark still, and I said, 
22 
no, I'm just leaving to pick up 
 'cause she got off.  I had her car, 'cause my truck is – 
23 
 
24 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
25 
 
26 
 
– blocking the driveway.  Um, and she's like, are you going home afterwards, and I 
27 
said yeah.  And I get to my daughter's work, and my daughter calls me back, and she says, hey, 
28 
dad's got the driveway like, um, baling wired or whatever.  I thought she said the front door.  Um, 
29 
and I was like, what?  And then I lost her, and I tried calling like three times, and got no answer, 
30 
and that's when 
r and, uh, 
 were – 
31 
 
32 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
33 
 
34 
 
– there at the coffee shop, and I was like, hey, 
 um, and he was like, oh, 
35 
you're here, and I was like, what, and then that's when he said that my son, 
 called him and 
36 
said that him and his dad were like in an argument and 
 had told Rick that what's been going 
37 
on is, like, messing with his mental health and that my son thought about killing himself, and Rick 
38 
told him just do it because then you wouldn't be dealing with what I'm dealing with.  It's horrible 
39 
because these are the memories that my son's gonna have forever.  ****.  And then, um, I was like, 
40 
wait, what, and 
 was like, don't go home, and he's like, go to the fire station.  Um, don't go 
41 
home.  I'm gonna see if I can get a hold of 
 or 
 and so me and my daughter went to 
42 
the fire station, and then I get a, a message from my neighbor across the street, um, she's like, hey, 
43 
Rick's going off on the kids.  He's like yelling at the top of his lungs, and I think he may have 
44 
pushed your son.  Um, she's like, it's not good, the vet clinic people had to come over and like 
45 
kinda like calm it down and like get the kids out. 
46 

OMAANDMNFLWNe

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

And I was like, okay, and um, then in that time, little bit as in that time frame is
when like called my daughter who was sitting next to me, and J **** I could hear him
yelling. I think he was yelling at Rick saying, I hope you don't ever have to deal with what I just
dealt with, and then he talked to a and said, hey, meet us at the fire station, we're on our way
or something like that. And then, that's kind of all that I heard, and then showed me some
of the video.

   

Other Speaker: So, he has video from earlier.

 
  

He has video Rick, um, grabbing him by the face, like right here, like shaking him,
and pull the pocketknife out and like put it to his own throat and like said just do it already to
Pd just do it already. Fuck.

Other Speaker: You're doing a great job.

Detective Castellanos: You are.

fF It's so hard.

Other Speaker: It is hard.

Detective Castellanos: You have been providing a lot of good detail and history, and **** it's, it's a
lot to say and take in, so you're doing a great job.

ok
Detective Castellanos: But thank you for talking to us.
Other Speaker: And I, I think you're almost there.

Detective Castellanos:Eh, yeah, we're almost done. I have a cup, or some questions I need to
clarify, just some dates and times and, and that's pretty much it for me.

Detective Castellanos: My partner over here might have some other questions, but uh, eh, earlier
you mentioned something about him going to your guys' room and he was packing his stuff.

Detective Castellanos: Was that that same day he came back for, in October 28th for the Halloween
event?

55

56 
 
 
Yes, it was the next day. 
1 
 
2 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  Um – 
3 
 
4 
 
Uh, we stepped out for a bit 'cause we had to go to the haunt to get costumes and od 
5 
makeup, and then we came back and then he was in the house, um, and he had mentioned the trailer 
6 
thing to my son, um, and myself, and then that's when I was just like, um, I don't know what I'm 
7 
doing.  I don't know if I'm gonna be here, and not only that, it's like, we pay for that stuff, like, a 
8 
year in advance.  It's not like it's just a quick fix. 
9 
 
10 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
11 
 
12 
 
Um, and then I went in my room and saw that, and then he came in there, and I said 
13 
can you please do this when I'm not here, and then he's like, oh, I'll move it out of your way so it's 
14 
not in your way, and then, he said, have a good event or something, and then he's like, I'll go, I'll go 
15 
outside, and then he went outside. 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, um, and then you said, uh, that you found out that the truck was 
18 
blocking, uh, the driveway.  That your driveway was blocking the driveway.  When did that 
19 
happen?  When did he start barricading that driveway? 
20 
 
21 
 
That was when he was yelling, I think he did it the night that he yelled at, uh, my 
22 
daughter and 
 from the haunted house, when we left, so that would have been Thursday, 
23 
yeah. 
24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: So, Thursday of last week? 
26 
 
27 
 
Uh, yeah, so it was Thursday, um, yes.   
28 
 
29 
Detective Castellanos: So. 
30 
 
31 
 
'Cause it was all this, yes, I think.  Oh, God, I don't know now. 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: So, on Thursday, the 9th, 'cause law enforcement was called on the, on 
34 
Saturday, the 11th. 
35 
 
36 
 
Yes. 
37 
 
38 
Detective Castellanos: Correct? 
39 
 
40 
 
Yes. 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so he started barricade the driveway with the truck. 
43 
 
44 
 
Mm hmm. 
45 
 
46 

Detective Castellanos: Which would be that red truck that's —

BE tom

Detective Castellanos:— red truck. Um, okay. And then, um, then you said something about him
leaving in the MINI Cooper **** something about 10:30 at night. I missed that.

Yeah, so when we pulled up coming back, um, he was leaving at the same that we
pulled up, and he rolled the window down and said, he was explaining why the truck was parked
there, basically. Um he —

Detective Castellanos:So, t hat was on the 9th.
F That was the Friday. Whatever that **** —
Other Speaker: Friday night.

ES Friday night.

Detective Castellanos:Friday night, so —
a
Detective Castellanos:— okay, Friday night.

Yeah, ‘cause I went up Thursday and it all went down on Thursday, and then I came
back Friday night.

Detective Castellanos: When you're saying you came back, you left the house. Sorry —

I was out of town, so I left Thursday night out of town, stayed the night in San, San
oh, um, at Great America, and then worked all day and then came back Friday —

Other Speaker: And iii was —

en

Other Speaker: — with you —

 

 
  

And iii was with me the whole time. Oh, and also, just **** I, I feel really bad
for my son, ‘cause I feel like he's gonna think a lot of this has to do with him because when
we were leaving, Rick asked if he could use Haunted Lake County's trailer, and I was packing up
the car with all my stuff, and came in and asked me, and I said, I think the trailer's full of
stuff. I didn't know. I thought there was still like wood and stuff from when we were doing
construction, and um, like, oh, I don't know, and then I went and asked who it's his
uncle's trailer, and I was like, hey, | | Rick's asking if he could use the Haunted Lake County's

   

 
   

 

57

58 
 
trailer, and he said, well, all he needs to do is just call 
 or my, or 
 'cause it's 
 
1 
trailer.  And I said, okay.  I loaded up the car some more.  Um, and kinda forgot, you know, about 
2 
the whole thing, 'cause my son was kinda dealing with it.  Well, I guess my son, I know this, texted 
3 
Rick and told him that 
 from the Haunted said he couldn't use it or not that he couldn't use it, 
4 
but they were gonna use it. 
5 
 
6 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
7 
 
8 
 
And then 
 went and found, um, a friend of ours that would allow him to use 
9 
the trailer in place of it, to kinda like diffuse the whole thing, and so I think 
 feels guilty 
10 
because he like didn't even ask 
 about the trailer.  He just went straight to someone else and 
11 
just kinda said, hey, they need the trailer, and that's what, I think, set Rick off was the fact that it 
12 
was parked on our property, and we do a lot for them, but they wouldn't, like, help him when he 
13 
needed to use it to move stuff from the office, and I think that kinda like started the whole thing. 
14 
 
15 
Other Speaker: 
Mm. 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, uh – 
18 
 
19 
 
I know 
 probably feels like, oh, my god, 'cause. 
20 
 
21 
Other Speaker: 
We can check that out with him. 
22 
 
23 
 
I know he's – 
24 
 
25 
Other Speaker: 
Okay, **** – 
26 
 
27 
 
– he's really – 
28 
 
29 
Other Speaker: 
– yeah. 
30 
 
31 
 
– he's really struggling.  He's been for a while, and he's so quiet, I can't get anything 
32 
out of that kid.   
33 
 
34 
Other Speaker: 
But we can't talk to him until after he's had a conversation with the 
35 
investigators, but we'll, we'll help sort that out, okay.   
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: We can talk to him next, that way – 
38 
 
39 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: – you guys can be together.  Um, 'cause it seems like he was the main person 
42 
that saw everything today.  Um, so um – 
43 
 
44 
 
Him and my daughter, both, but I think – 
45 
 
46 

Detective Castellanos right?

- eah, | | said that he was pooping, and he was banging on the screen

door to get let in, and went down and said, oh, sorry, I was pooping, and he's like, I don't
give a fuck or something, and then went off on is from what said is kinda how it
started.

Detective Castellanos:Okay. Um, so on the 11th, um, | | needed his trailer, so law enforcement
was called that time. You said the kids, that they cut the lock to the gate on the side. Which kids
were those?

eo

Detective Castellanos: Okay.

| I think was the one that cut it, but went with him.

Detective Castellanos:Okay, um —

Also, one of the days that, um, the weekend prior to that, which kinda like alerted
everybody at the haunt, 'cause they went to drop off the trailers, and it was raining that day, and
Rick was in his wet suit playing fetch with Levi in the yard, and he was like, oh, oh, I went
kayaking to the guys, and they were like, the kayak was like strapped to the roof of the RV, and it's
not an easy task —

Other Speaker: Mm hmm.

— so it was kind of like, they thought that kind of weird, like maybe he was, thought
that it was kinda odd, and so he covered it by saying he went kayaking, I don't know, but I got
home like 10 minutes maybe after that 'cause it was like in crossing of leaving the haunt and
getting home that they said that they talked to him and he was in a wet suit in the rain, and uh, I got
home and when I got home, he was in the pool, swimming. But he was in the pool swimming until
like 2 or 3 in the morning, in that wet suit. Um, and across the street said that about 10:30,
11:00, he, Rick opened his door, so —

Other Speaker: RR | | door?

Yeah. Like, opened his house door to tell him that there was a light on or
something. I don't know. But that was just kind of odd.

Other Speaker: That was the weekend before this last weekend?

v2.

Detective Castellanos:Okay, um, and then you said, on your birthday, the 13th, um, he gave you,
um, a house plan and a card.

60 
 
 
1 
 
Mm hmm. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: What is a house plan, like, like, what is that?  Like – 
4 
 
5 
 
Just a plant, like for inside the house, not like an outside plant.  It's just a plant for 
6 
inside your house. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Oh, a plant. 
9 
 
10

2 
Detective Castellanos: Sorry. 
3 
 
4 
 
Yeah, it's okay.   
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: Eh, uh, okay.  We clarified that.  And, um, so walk me back through the last 
7 
24-hours, and I'm gonna be asking questions pertaining to like the coroner aspect of the 
8 
investigation. 
9 
 
10 
 
In the last 24 hours – 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: **** like, um – 
13 
 
14 
 
So, it was – 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: – hah, how was his demeanor at that time?  So, just, with the last 24-hours. 
17 
 
18 
 
Well, I didn't see him when I came home from work.  I didn't see him at all 
19 
yesterday.  I came home, and he was in his RV, and then he was playing loud music, like, loud.  I'm 
20 
surprised no neighbors complained.  Um, and it was like 7:00, 7:10.  He was playing the song that, 
21 
um, he was playing a song that his friend recorded, and it has to do with like my body, my choice, 
22 
I will not like give into, like, um, give in, basically, with like the vaccines and the shit – 
23 
 
24 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
25 
 
26 
 
– that's going on in the world and taxes and Biden and all that stuff, and he played it 
27 
played like on loop.  Like I think he played it like 3 times, and he like upped the volume on it like 
28 
definitely trying to make a message to anyone that was around that he's not gonna abide and back 
29 
down and whatever, and then I watched him, like, walk, um, I actually think I got maybe even a 
30 
little bit of video of him down there.  He was just kinda standing there staring off into the yard with 
31 
that music playing and then he walked to the RV.  He went, uh, I was getting ready for, like I said, 
32 
and I, I saw him walking up to the house.  He opened the door, he set down the mortgage bill on the 
33 
footstool by the door, and then he walked back out.  Me and my daughter fed the cat.  We left.  Um, 
34 
and then all of a sudden, Levi started barking, I looked back, and he was coming, Rick and Levi 
35 
was coming from the pool and just walked, uh, was walking to the RV.  And we just got in the car 
36 
and – 
37 
 
38 
Other Speaker: 
That was – 
39 
 
40 
 
– and left.   
41 
 
42 
Other Speaker:

46 

62 
 
Other Speaker:

2 
 
Um, it was, no he stopped playing music at like 7:10. 
3

Um, we left the house about 8 – 
7

Other Speaker: 
Okay.

Forty. 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: 8:40 in the morning? 
13 
 
14 
 
Mm hmm. 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. So you last saw him alive at around that time. 
17 
 
18 
 
8:40. 
19 
 
20 
Detective Castellanos: 8:40.  Um, I know we talked about, um, his drug usage, his alcohol usage, 
21 
his mental health.  He never went to any sort of counseling.  He's never been into like a psychiatric, 
22 
uh, facility, nothing like that?  Even as a child or **** – 
23 
 
24 
 
I think his mom like **** 'cause a while back, she had mentioned something about 
25 
he went through therapy, maybe when he was younger.  I coulda swore she said like 16, maybe.  
26 
Um, but she said she just thought it was just teen, typical teenager stuff.  Um, 'cause we had talked 
27 
a little bit about, like, how he's just, how angry he is with the world and how everything's going and 
28 
that they're out to kill us all, and we're all gonna die soon, and he had like a lot of conspiracy 
29 
theories on what's gonna happen in the next year or so or whatever, I – 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  Uh – 
32 
 
33 
 
Um, I know that he had a brush with the law, like, prior to me getting together with 
34 
him, um, for like loud music or something, and during that time, they had him seeing somebody 
35 
and had him on antidepressants, I think.  Yeah. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: So, when you're was saying that he had a brush with the law, like – 
38 
 
39 
 
It was for loud music **** – 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: Did he get in trouble for it? 
42 
 
43 
 
Yeah, he got arrested for it. 
44 
 
45 
Detective Castellanos: That was here in Lake County? 
46 

63 
 
 
1 
 
No, it was like when we first, before we ever started dating. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
4 
 
5 
 
Um, god, I don't know, 25 years ago. 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: How did he feel against law enforcement?  What was his idea or his 
8 
thoughts on law enforcement? 
9 
 
10 
 
Other than him saying if they came on our property, he wasn't afraid to like do 
11 
anything.  I mean, he didn't seem like – 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: What did he say about that, like, like, can you elaborate a little bit more 
14 
**** – 
15 
 
16 
 
I didn't wit, I didn't witness it.  The kids did. 
17 
 
18 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
19 
 
20 
 
Um, they heard him say it, and they have, my daughter has it on video. 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
23 
 
24 
 
Um, that's when he said that if anybody calls the cops, he's gonna booby trap it and 
25 
this and that, and I think he may have even said stuff to my, my other, older boys about, like, 
26 
having like weapons and stuff, but. 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: So, all that is in recording? 
29 
 
30 
 
Uh, I don't know about with my older boys, but the whole thing about, um, the 
31 
booby trapping and all that stuff, and the poisons and gases and stuff is on recording. 
32 
 
33 
Detective Castellanos: And who has those, again? 
34 
 
35 
 
My daughter – 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: Ah,

45 

64 
 
Detective Castellanos: – I wrote that somewhere around here.  Um, **** but has he ever made any 
1 
comments or concerns about you with law enforcement that were concerning to you or that he 
2 
hated law enforcement?

4 
 
Not, not 'til recently, no.  He's never really had anything, mm mm. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: Okay so, not 'til recently.  Like, he's made those sort of comments to you 
7

He had told my kids – 
23 
 
24 
Detective Castellanos: – prescribed medication. 
25 
 
26 
 
– my older boys that he was micro dosing mushrooms.  I don't know what that is.  
27 
That and marijuana, and he like, he stopped drinking, but he was still, um, smoking weed and 
28 
micro dosing mushrooms, but uh, I, I don't know what that means or what that is. 
29 
 
30 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  Um, do you know when he last saw, uh, like a doctor or a dentist? 
31 
 
32 
 
Mm, last time he saw a doctor was probably when the twins were born, um, their 19 
33 
now.  Um, he had like a, his ankle swelled up really big and he had to get some tests, and they said 
34 
that he had rheumatoid arthritis, and um, ah, what was the other thing, ankle, oh, something, ankle 
35 
something.  I don't know, and so he was like on, um – 
36 
 
37 
Other Speaker: 
Ankylosing spondylitis.  
38 
 
39 
 
I think that's what it was, something like that, yeah. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: Wow.   
42 
 
43 
 
Yeah.  Uh, yeah.

45 
Other Speaker: 
**** I can even spell it. 
46 

65 
 
 
1 
 
Um, yeah, he had that, and um, so it was rheumatoid arthritis and that, and they had 
2 
him on like prednisone, they had him on like a lot of hard, um, medications during that time.  That 
3 
made him really angry, honestly. 
4 
 
5 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, um, who was his doctor at that time? 
6 
 
7 
 
I don't know.  It was somebody in Santa Rosa. 
8 
 
9 
Detective Castellanos: Santa Rosa? 
10 
 
11 
 
Mm hmm. 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  Do you, do you know if he was eating? 
14 
 
15 
 
Like recently? 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Like regularly, recently? 
18 
 
19 
 
I don't think he was.  He was telling the kids that he was eating a can of, uh, food a 
20 
day or something like that, and he's got a stockpile to last him a long time.  He can bunker down 
21 
and be here for a while. 
22 
 
23 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, so you don't know what he last ate, then? 
24 
 
25 
 
No. 
26 
 
27 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
28 
 
29 
 
No.  He **** whatever he was eating, he was doing in the RV.  Um, he came in one 
30 
night, um, it was like a large can of like raviolis or something and asked for a bowl. 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.  Um, basically, everything else, I already asked with everything 
33 
we've talked about, um.  I can't think of anything else **** – 
34 
 
35 
Other Speaker: 
Do you have like video cameras and stuff at your house? 
36 
 
37 
 
Well, see, that's the thing is he had like, a while ago, months ago, he had one on our 
38 
garage and one on our porch and one **** the back yard, and they were on briefly for a while, and 
39 
then when he hadn't come home, I turned them off because I was like, you know, I don't, he didn't 
40 
wanna be a part of our lives.  I don't want him, like, spying on us. 
41 
 
42 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
43 
 
44 
 
But with that being said, he did tell my son, when my son came up visiting over that 
45 
hall, the haunt weekend, that um, he put up other ones or he rehooked them up.  I don't know.  I 
46 

66 
 
don't, I don't know where they would be.  The one that's in the front porch is still unplugged.  One 
1 
of 'em, I think he said he put in his RV and then the other one would be still facing the back yard, 
2 
but I don't know, they're just like ones that you put into the light socket and then – 
3 
 
4 
Other Speaker: 
Mm hmm. 
5 
 
6 
 
– he has control of it on his phone, so. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Do you know if he, um, was having a relationship with anybody else or 
9 
anything like that? 
10 
 
11 
 
My son said that he said that he had a girlfriend today. 
12 
 
13 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
14 
 
15 
 
I don't know.  He said that he has a girlfriend, and she makes millions. 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: ****. 
18 
 
19 
 
That's what he told 
  I don't know.  Uh, he said, 
 said he saw a picture 
20 
of her on his phone.  On his background or something. 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: So, before August, basically. 
23 
 
24 
 
Mm hmm. 
25 
 
26 
Detective Castellanos: Before August, it seems like, eh, from August to now, that's when things 
27 
started to escalate a lot. 
28 
 
29 
 
Mm hmm. 
30 
 
31 
Detective Castellanos: Um, with how he was acting, what he was saying, stuff like that.  Before 
32 
then, since August and before, or before your 25 years or throughout your entire 25 years of 
33 
marriage – 
34 
 
35 
 
Mm hmm. 
36 
 
37 
Detective Castellanos: – I understand that he would, um, basically make you feel low – 
38 
 
39 
 
Mm hmm. 
40 
 
41 
Detective Castellanos: – basically, and, uh, and that he never put his hands on you – 
42 
 
43 
 
Mm hmm. 
44 
 
45 

67 
 
Detective Castellanos: – and stuff like that, but he would always be depressed and talked about 
1 
hating world and society and stuff like that.  Um, did he ever act like he was acting in August to 
2 
now? 
3 
 
4 
 
No, this, this, right here, is the worst it's ever been. 
5 
 
6 
Detective Castellanos: So, it just started from one day to another just like that? 
7 
 
8 
 
He's always, like, yeah.  It was like, it was like a flick, like, like his personality 
9 
changed and everything.  You know, he went from like, from wearing like, you know, a redneck 
10 
and jeans and stuff to wearing moccasins and being this hippy and drum circles and, yeah, uh, he 
11 
just changed personality, like, like, like that, and I just thought that maybe that was what was 
12 
helping him heal, that he met people on the beach and started, like, talking to people and like got 
13 
information from them on what he could do and I – 
14 
 
15 
Other Speaker: 
He wasn't in like a car accident or anything or some type of **** – 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Head trauma? 
18 
 
19 
 
Years ago.  Years and years and years ago, he was in a car accident, and he hit his 
20 
head, and he complained about that a lot, still, like his head hurt from that, and his neck. 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
23 
 
24 
 
Yeah, that was like before I was ever with him.  It was during – 
25 
 
26 
Other Speaker: 
Oh, a long time. 
27 
 
28 
 
– college and it was his girlfriend in his car or something. 
29 
 
30 
Other Speaker: 
Nothing more recent? 
31 
 
32 
 
Mm mm, mm. 
33 
 
34 
Detective Castellanos: Um, was he married before you? 
35 
 
36 
 
Mm mm, nope, we've been, we've known each other since we were 15. 
37 
 
38 
Detective Castellanos: Okay, 'cause you have, uh, uncommon kid with *** so, were you married – 
39 
 
40 
 
So, we dated – 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: – before? 
43 
 
44 
 
– no, no, um, me and Rick dated in high school.  He was my high school sweetheart.  
45 
We had a moment in high school.  He graduated.  I was still in school.  He left, did his thing.  I met 
46 

68 
 
my, my oldest son's father.  Um, that didn't work out.  Uh, he was doing, Rick was doing music 
1 
with my brother, 'cause he was doing like sound and recordings and stuff like that.  My brother had 
2

3 
the house one day, and I was like, oh, shit, Rick, you know, and we reconnected, and my, at that 
4

1 
 
Yeah. 
2 
 
3 
Detective Castellanos: – since they were both the ones that saw most of this.  Um, they're

conversations shouldn't be too long about history and stuff like that, like it was with you. 
5 
 
6 
 
Yeah. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: It should be a little quicker with them, so, okay.

Other Speaker: 
And I have cautioned them not to talk.

the night. 
34 
 
35 
 
Okay. 
36 
 
37 
Other Speaker: 
I'm here until the kids are done, 'cause I'm sure that you're not going 
38 
anywhere until after the kids are all interviewed, um, and I just lost my train of thought. 
39 
 
40 
 
Oh, I feel so sick. 
41 
 
42 
Other Speaker: 
Yeah. 
43 
 
44 
Detective Castellanos: So, one other question, sorry, now that I'm looking – 
45 
 
46 

72 
 
 
****. 
1 
 
2 
Detective Castellanos: – here at my notes, from your birthday to this morning, you didn't see him 
3 
for those three days until this morning? 
4 
 
5 
 
Mm hmm. 
6 
 
7 
Detective Castellanos: Where was he at? 
8 
 
9 
 
Hibernating in his RV. 
10 
 
11 
Detective Castellanos: Got it. 
12 
 
13 
 
I mean, I would see him, like, maybe open the door to let the dog in and out, or 
14 
whatever, or maybe walk around the property, but not like – 
15 
 
16 
Detective Castellanos: He was in the RV. 
17 
 
18 
 
Yeah. 
19 
 
20 
Detective Castellanos: So, since he arrived back from the, on October 28th, back home, he's been 
21 
staying out in the RV? 
22 
 
23 
 
He's never come back in the house in the last 3 months. 
24 
 
25 
Detective Castellanos: So, since – 
26 
 
27 
 
Strictly RV. 
28 
 
29 
Detective Castellanos: – that pool conversation that you guys had.  With that pool conversation, did 
30 
you mention, like, divorce or – 
31 
 
32 
 
No – 
33 
 
34 
Detective Castellanos: – anything like that? 
35 
 
36 
 
– we, we talked about, um, probably reconcile and like, you know, just, we just 
37 
needed time. 
38 
 
39 
Detective Castellanos: Time, just like a break basically – 
40 
 
41 
 
Mm hmm. 
42 
 
43 
Detective Castellanos: - from each other? 
44 
 
45 
 
Mm hmm. 
46 

73 
 
 
1 
Detective Castellanos: Okay.   
2 
 
3 
 
And even at that last conv, that, when I went and visited him prior to him coming 
4 
and bringing me the flowers, we never talked about it, and even, like, when he left in that 
5 
argument, he said that he would never divorce, he'd just, do you, I do me, is what he told me when 
6 
he left, so. 
7 
 
8 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
9 
 
10 
 
Yeah. 
11 
 
12 
Detective Castellanos: Well, thank you for talking to us.  If I have any other questions, I hope I 
13 
don't, but I'm pretty sure I will, eventually, through, throughout the days or something like that.  
14 
 
15 
 
Mm hmm. 
16 
 
17 
Detective Castellanos: Something's gonna pop up.  Um, I'll call you or I'll just, do you plan on 
18 
going back to the house or? 
19 
 
20 
 
I don't know.  I don't know what it look, I don't know what – 
21 
 
22 
Detective Castellanos: Um, I don't know how long we're gonna be out there for, okay, so – 
23 
 
24 
Other Speaker: 
Do you have somewhere to go tonight? 
25 
 
26 
 
I do, I have friends that have a lake house, and – 
27 
 
28 
Detective Castellanos: Okay. 
29 
 
30 
 
– they're supposed to be on their way here to like – 
31 
 
32 
Detective Castellanos: It would probably be – 
33 
 
34 
 
– help us. 
35 
 
36 
Detective Castellanos: – best to probably stay away from the house for at least a couple days or 
37 
until tomorrow or so.  We will let you know when we're done there if you want.  Um, that'll 
38 
probably be better.  We'll let you know once we're done and out from there, okay. 
39 
 
40 
 
Okay. 
41 
 
42 
Detective Castellanos: Um, so yeah.

  He talked to the family, um, 
last night in depth for quite a while, so I think he's actually meeting with them today as well. 
 
Speaker 1: 
That must been an interesting conversation. 
 
Speaker 2: 
I can't ****. 
 
Speaker 1:

unravel so fast and so hard core in my life –

Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I mean, so what does, what does, what does the family say about it?  I mean, 'cause, 
so I just, I, uh, find it really hard to believe that someone could turn a 360 like that, like, so quick 
without drugs being involved. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah.  Um – 
 
Speaker 1: 
But, uh, they, they, they have no clue, huh?

Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2:

I have watched him raise five kids – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yep. 
 
Speaker 1:

roadwork, and he doesn't – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Oh. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– wanna do all this other stuff, but, you know, but all that aside, bro, uh, he was a, 
he was a good guy.  You know, he was a de, he, at one time, you know, I don't think he was really 
good with money to be honest.  I don't know because he, he had, he had declared bankruptcy, and 
he made sure his kids had all, you know, all, they all had cars or whatever.  I don't, I don't have 
things to do with any of that, but I do know that he left in that motor home, and when he came back, 
he was a completely different human being.  **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
When did he leave in the motor home? 
 

Speaker 1: 
Uh, he was, he left about, he just returned a couple weeks ago, and he, he left so a 
couple weeks ago, but it's now it's, no, so that would have been like, he returned late October. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Probably been gone the whole month of October. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, I, I, I mean, I, I can't guarantee, uh, how accurate that is, but. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I do know that he left, and when he came back, he was, he just started acting like a 
freakin' maniac, bro, you know, like talking about the CIA and his dad was CIA and all this, you 
know, you know, how he wanted to start a rock band and just kick all the kids out of the house 
because they're, uh, they're, look, they range from like 17 to 20, and he is screaming at his poor, 
poor kids like how they don't help pay for the house and all this other stuff, and I'm like, dude, you, 
what do you mean, what do you mean.  What are you talking about – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– bro.  They're just kids. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, literally, they're just, they're the same exact age as my kids, so. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Was it just yesterday that he was yelling at 'em? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, dude.  I was, I came around the corner, and I saw 
 get dropped off by a 
friend, and while 
 
 was walking to try to get in the house, I, I, I continued up the street 
and, and went inside. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
But, um, Rick was in the process of, like, chu, their driveway **** fencing off the 
driveway so no one could come in. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Um, and then I left again, and he was screaming at 
 dude, I mean, to, at the 
top of his lungs, and then, and then, uh, 
 the youngest girl, came in, and I seen Rick just, 
just laying into these poor kids, man, about how they don't pay, and they, they, they, they're not 
welcome here anymore.  They can't come here ever gain, that, that he's kicking 'em out.  Um, now 

I didn't see him push to the ground, but I a saw all of that part, and it got so bad that
our buddy, who works at the, uh, uh, .

Speaker 2: Mmhmm.

Speaker 1: Uh, had to come out and, like, you know —

Speaker 2: And I talked to him yesterday as well.

Speaker 1: You, you did?

Speaker 2: Mmhmm.

Speaker 1: | Yeah, so he came out, and then does he know what happened —

Speaker 2: — Uh, just to—

Speaker 1: §— just the final outcome of all this.

Speaker 2: Um-—

Speaker 1: He is a good dude —

Speaker 2: —I'm not quite sure —

Speaker 1: - is a solid dude —

Speaker 2: —actually —

Speaker 1: | — but, he's awesome. Um, but he came out and just had, had to like.

Speaker 2: Mmhmm.

Speaker 1: Kinda like mellow the whole scene out. You know, I don't know what happened
after that, but, um, I know, uh, I have been seeing Rick like, uh, well, act like a freaking maniac just
taking all of his shit that he owns or whatever and, and putting it next to the motor home and
building that little, like, all his, his plywood and all that shit up against the motor home and just
running around the property and move cars and —

Speaker 2: Mmhmm.

Speaker 1: —just crazy, dude, like, crazy, and screaming at the top of his lungs, music blaring,
dude, all this crazy like.

Speaker 2: Well what'd you see after the kids left?

Speaker 1: 
Yesterday? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Okay.  So you wanna start, I'll start from the very beginning. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Sure. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Uh, uh, that's why I'm sure that the first police, uh, the sheriffs came is because I 
think I'm pretty sure I don't think 
 called the cops.  I think the people at 
 called the 
cops. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
But I'm not sure about that, but again, I don't think anybody else did.  I know 
 
didn't and I know 
 didn't.  I didn't, so it had to be 
  Um, so the short, uh, sergeant that 
walks with a limp, you know what I mean – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm.  Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– super cool dude.  Um, he is the first cop on scene.  He comes up around the 
corner, and he is about to make a U-turn, and I'm sitting in front of 
 house right there. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And we're watching Rick just, hmm, running around the property, like, collecting 
shit, moving cars, dude, and, uh, moving, uh, he moved his truck, the black Suburban and the little 
mini up 'cause he couldn't get, get in the driveway, so he had to pull around 
 property, open 
the gate and move everything, like, you know, and well, and after he's doing that, he is running 
around, uh, moving all kids shit, screaming at the top of his lungs about how, how he doesn't want 
anybody over there no more, and then I told the police officer before he got out of his truck that 
Rick has straight up lost it, and he's got a weapon. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, 'cause I, I, I thought it was really important he know that he's got a gun, 
bro, you know what I mean, and I told 
 yeah, 2 days ago when I found out that Rick had a gun 
that the man's, someone needs to literally take that gun away from him 'cause someone's gonna get 
hurt. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Because he was, he's just not himself at all.  He's, I don't know what to call it, dude.  
I don't know.  Um, so he gets out.  He makes a U-turn, and he gets out, and, uh, he is, uh, standing 
in the front of the driveway and waiting for backup, you know what I mean – 
 

Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– because he didn't, I don't know.  Like, that's what you guys do.  You have to have 
backup in a situation like that, right? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
So, um, so, uh, 4 minutes max, you know, guys have, it was four, four of you guys 
deep up here, uh, and so they're sitting, they're sitting at the, at the gate that he has just got done 
putting up, like, right, and, uh, he, Rick sees the police, and he, he is g, he runs up to the fence, and 
he's got this little sign.  It's still there.  I saw it this morning.  It's a little tiny sign that says no 
trespassing, and he runs up to the gate, and he tapes the gate, and beelines back to the motor home 
like this. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know what I mean, and, uh, so he goes back in the motor home, and the, and 
then, the, the police were like, the sheriffs were like just, Rick.  We just wanna talk.  Uh, uh, so 
many, you know, uh, they said this a million times.  We just wanna talk.  We just wanna talk, and 
this was before the weapon was even drawn or any of that, uh, we just wanna talk.  We, what's 
going on, dude.  We just wanna help.  You know what I mean.  Uh, so, so they, the, the, the police 
sat there for a minute, and they're, and they're, they're talking to, uh, to, uh, you know, I'm not sure 
exactly what's said.  I wasn't that close.  I was like in front of 
 house, and then they're trying 
to come up with some kind of plan, you know what I mean, like what are we gonna do here.  You 
know, he's obviously got a weapon, and now he's locked in the, in the, in the motor home.  Uh, so 
they, they kinda dismantled the, the, the fence that he, he made, and, uh, the one sergeant got up 
under there, and they moved the fence back a little bit, and they, and they all ended up getting in, 
on, you know, on the property, so, hmm, **** let me, let me think about this for a second.  So this 
is, this is before any weapons are drawn or anything.  They, as they're coming through the gate, 
 comes out, 
 comes out of the motor home – 
 
Speaker 2: 
You mean Rick – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– right.  Rick, sorry – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– Rick, Rick comes out of the motor home, and he looks, and he's just, he's got 
sunglasses on and a beanie, but I could just tell that he was just like in a manic state, dude.  Like, he 
was insane, bro.  Um, he, he didn't like the police being there obviously.  Uh, he had just gotten in 
a huge fight with two of his kids, um, so he looks at the police, and he goes, ""Get the fuck out of 
here.  This is my house.  You're trespassing,"" uh, and then he grabs, I don't, I think the dog was in 
the back, but he, for some reason, dude, he grabbed a dolly.  Uh, he had that yellow dolly that's 
sitting in front of the motor home, and he started, he was just like didn't wanna talk to the police at 
all.  He said get off my property, and he grabs the dolly like he's gonna go, go do some work and 
move some stuff, you know, like in the back – 

 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– right.  Uh, meantime, the police they're all just saying, ""Dude, we just wanna talk.  
We just wanna help.  We want to wanna help,"" uh, and then all of a sudden, you know, this is 
about, and they're just like, there's four of 'em, like, uh, sitting right around here, uh, and then, uh, 
Rick comes, Rick comes out of the back yard where the pool, there is a gate there, and there where 
the pool is back there – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– have you been back there? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
He comes out of there, dude, and he is like in a little mini trot, and he's got his dog, 
and he, I saw this with my own eyes, dude, he came out, and he put his hand right here, dude, and 
he goes, ""I am armed.  I am armed.  I'm armed,"" and that's when everything changed, you know, 
and everything just went, got. 
 
Speaker 2: 
You're indicating that he put his hand right at his waistline? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Dude, yeah.  Absolutely.  Hundred percent.  ""I am armed.  I am armed.""  He said it 
like four or five times with his dog right here, and he is, and then the police, the whole, the whole 
vibe changed right then.  Uh, they are all like, you know, like this, boom, still the whole time, 
""Rick, we just wanna help.  Drop the gun now,"" and now they're saying drop the gun. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know what I mean, so Rick, Rick turns around and beelines in the back, and 
this is where it gets kinda weird for all of us, uh, for all of me, 
 and 
  I was standing, uh, 
 front, you know, her, her white gate right there. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I was, the whole length of it.  I was standing like halfway down her gate, her fence 
line so I could see what was going on.  I'm, I, I cannot definitively say exactly who shot, who, who 
fired first, but I think one of the officers fired a warning shot – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 

Speaker 1: 
You know what I mean, just, ""Rick, drop the gun.  Drop the gun.  Drop the gun,"" 
you know, and he wouldn't drop the gun, dude.  He was, he was out of his mind – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Did you, do you see him holding the gun? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Who? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Rick. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yes, I did. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Uh, absolutely, absolutely. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Uh, he ran and, and, and, uh, he, he took the dog, and he ran back behind that fence, 
right, and I am not, I, I cannot tell you if Rick fired the first shot or if, uh, the officer fired a warning 
shot.  I don't know.  Nobody knows 'cause it's kinda hard to tell who is shooting – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– and who is popping it.  You know what I mean.  There was definitely four or five 
shots for sure.  No question.  Like, we all know that. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Um, but none of us can definitively say that we saw Rick fire a shot because he was 
in the back. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I just, I can't.  I don't know, you know.  From by, by the body language and the 
action from the officers, it's kinda obvious that he must have fired a shot, right. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Hmm, now, now you said that he was holding the gun.  What was he doing with the 
gun? 
 
Speaker 1: 
I am armed.  I am armed.  I am armed just like this – 
 
Speaker 2: 
So you're indicating it was holding it up in the air? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah.  
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 

 
Speaker 1: 
That's, uh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– you, uh, and everybody knows, you know, once you pull a gun on a, on a police 
officer, dude, that the game, it's a game changer. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, it's like you can't do that, bro.  It's like, and I was, you know, and the 
shots were really sporadic, bro.  They were like in 2, 2, 3-minute inter, intervals. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
It was crazy.  It was never any pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  It was like pop, 2 minutes, 
3 minutes, pop.  You know, like, but n, none of us can really definitively say that we saw ro, Rick 
fire a shot, you know, and, um, I am not a police officer.  It's not what I do.  Uh, I've never been in 
a situation with a man who pulled a gun on me, you know what I mean, so I can't speak – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– on that at all.  Uh, the police, in my opinion, my personal opinion, did what they 
had to do given the circumstances and what they, the, the information that they had, you know.  He 
was, Rick was freaking crazy.  That's all there is to it, and, and you don't, and, and it was a tragic 
ending, bro.  I mean, I, you know – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Now you said you heard the, the deputies on scene talking to him.  What were they 
saying? 
 
Speaker 1: 
To Rick? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Man, we just, you know, drop the gun, Rick.  Drop the gun, and they said it a 
thousand times, bro.  They, you know, we just wanna help.  We just wanna help.  Stop.  Please, 
Rick just talk to us, you know what I mean, just like that, you know.  Um, and, uh, the, the, by that, 
by that time, dude, there was like, I didn't even know you guys had that many sheriffs in this 
county.  Uh, it was – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– seriously you guys showed up like a friggin' army, dude. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 

Speaker 1: 
Like good ol' boys.  I mean, it was crazy.  Um, but, uh, I don't know.  I mean, I just 
don't know.  I didn't see anything that went on in the back, so I, I really can't say anything else.  I 
don't, I don't know, and, you know, if you have any more questions, I'll be glad to ask – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Did – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– uh, answer it. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Did you see any, like, uh, you said that he was talking about, like, I have a gun.  Get 
off my property.  Did you hear him say anything else to the officers? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Get off my property. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
That's about it. 
 
Speaker 2: 
All right. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And his body language was so sporadic, bro.  He was crazy, and it's definitely 5150. 
 
Speaker 2: 
What do you mean sporadic? 
 
Speaker 1: 
I mean, he was just all over the place, dude.  I mean, before he even pulled out the 
gun, uh, he was just like moving shit, like just to, for no reason.  I mean, just like – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– and he was talking to himself.  You know, um, I could see when he came out, 
when he actually noticed that the police were there, his whole trip changed.  He was just like oh, 
shit, so he went in, went back inside and wrote that little sign.  It's so ridiculous, like, this big, dude, 
in little tiny letters no trespassing. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And he, he went and taped it like over the fence right there, and then he ran back to 
the motor home, and then, uh, I don't know. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Now you said that you saw him – 
 
Speaker 1: 
I don't know – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– like put his hand on his waist and say I have a gun. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I am armed. 
 

Speaker 2: 
I am armed. 
 
Speaker 1: 
That's what he said – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– I am armed – 
 
Speaker 2: 
And – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– numerous times, bro. 
 
Speaker 2: 
And then you saw him have the gun in his hand. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I seen, I seen him like this.  I'm like, he had his dog in his hand, and he was running 
toward the police like this, right. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And then, and then for some reason, he just turned around and went back, and then 
I don't, dude, see, I was standing over here.  I couldn't see after he goes past the, the fence line and 
d, near the pool. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I can't see any more. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
So I don't know if he was the one that took the first shot or if the police shot a 
warning shot.  I am not sure what protocol is with that.  I don't, I don't know.  I'm not a police 
officer, so. 
 
Speaker 2: 
And how, how long between the cops getting on scene to the point where you heard 
the shot, how long, uh, time wise do you think that was? 
 
Speaker 1: 
From, from when the first officer showed up? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
From when the very first officer showed up.  Okay.  From the very first o – you 
wanna know, well, how long it was from the very first officer showed up to an actual shot fired? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Have you talked to 
 yet, 
? 

 
Speaker 2: 
I have not. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah.   He, he – 
 
Speaker 2: 
I think he was driving away last night.  We didn't get a chance to talk to him – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, you were here last night – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yes – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– too?  Okay – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– yeah – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– okay.  Okay.  Got – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– gotcha.  Um.  Let me think about this for a minute, dude.  All right, so, um, the 
sergeant, the, the, the sheriff sergeant shows up.  I talk to him and tell him Rick's got a gun.  He 
goes okay.  Go back to wherever you're going.  He, he turned around here, and he parked, and he 
got out of the car, so, and then more backup came.  From when the first police officer arrived to the 
very first shot, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say 7 minutes. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay.   
 
Speaker 1: 
Does that sound or does that? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Hmm, I, I don't know – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– I, we just, I'm just trying to get an idea of like because there was obviously like 
verbal engagement between both – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, a hundred – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– like, everybody – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– percent.  Yeah.  
 
Speaker 2: 
And the cops – 
 
Speaker 1: 
As it should – 
 

Speaker 2: 
– talking to hi – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– right? 
 
Speaker 2: 
– ex, exactly, and the cops talking to him – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– uh, so I was just trying to get a, kind of a timeframe.  Obviously – 
 
Speaker 1: 
****  
 
Speaker 2: 
– perception during that dynamic – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Well, the, re, absolutely, there's gonna be discrepancies for sure.  Uh, you know, 
but, I mean, uh, if you, if you take everybody's statement, especially because me – 
 
Speaker 2: 
And I talked to 
  I talked to – 
 
Speaker 1: 
See, 
 
 – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– 
 – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– was right there.  I was standing right next to 
 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And 
 I, I, after the first shot, dude, I was like, oh, shit.  This is getting fuckin' 
crazy, so I was, we're, uh, g, uh, 
 was in his garage, so I walked up his driveway and cut 
through this little area and walked up and sat in the garage with, with 
 and just like, dude.  Is 
there any way that we could try to help deescalate this, dude, like, uh, like just say, like, I almost 
wanted to just walk up there and just start talking to 
 and just say, dude, you know, but I, I'm 
not a police officer, dude, just, I can't do that – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– you know, they won't let me do that.  You know, I could get shot. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Uh, and like you said, he was, he didn't seem like he was – 
 
Speaker 1: 
He wasn't – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– himself at that point, so – 
 
Speaker 1: 
No, and he was not lucid – 
 

Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– at all whatsoever, and I don't even know.  That's why I'm just really curious to see 
if there's any drugs in his system, dude.  I'm, I don't know. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
But he was really and hellbent on this whole conspiracy, Trump, fuckin' vaccine 
and the CIA shit, people trying to get him, like all this crazy stuff, you know. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Did you ever hear him make any threats or anything like that about harming himself 
or others? 
 
Speaker 1: 
No. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Never.  No, Rick wasn't, dude, that's why, that's why this is so crazy 'cause Rick is 
like this big. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
He is like a really tall, a really, really short little small little dude, you know what I 
mean, and he, u, he's never, he owns a business in town, dude, and, you know, he is, he is just like, 
I have known him, uh, I've seen, like I said, I've watched him raise these kids for 20 years, bro.  I 
have been here for a long time, and, uh, and my kids are the same exact age as his kids, and, you 
know, really, really out of character. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I'll put it that way, uh, so, so much so that his wife and kids must be going like what 
the hell just happened, bro. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
The last month of their life has been insanity, you know, because this guy has just 
unraveled, so wherever he went, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna take it upon myself to find exactly 
where he went with that RV and go talk to the people he was hanging out with because evidently, 
he was, he took the RV up north to this river, which I'm not sure where at exactly, but he was 
hanging out with these hippies.  That's what I heard, um, and, and all of a sudden, he comes home, 
and he wants to start a rock band, and he wants to, he wants to turn his, his house into a club and 
have rock bands play, and, uh, never once in 20 years did he ever set up a stereo system and play 
with music like that.  When he got back, he set up this whole huge PA rig, and he was blasting this 
crazy music, dude. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 

 
Speaker 1: 
And it was just like what's going on with Rick, dude – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Just out of character. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, yeah, 100 percent, 100 percent, you know, and it's just, it's all really sad.  I feel 
so sorry for 
 and the kids.  I don't know what they're gonna do to keep this house, bro, but like 
I said, uh, Rick, the last week, 2 weeks of him being here, he was on a mission, bro.  He wanted, he 
wanted nothing to do with his family, nothing to do with his kids. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
He never went to work.  He just, he just, just gave everything up.  It's the craziest 
thing, so I mean, that's all I got **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah, it's not often that you see somebody's mind cha, uh, mindset – 
 
Speaker 1: 
No, not, not – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– change like that. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– like that, dude. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
'Cause he was, I don't know if he is a religious guy, uh, ever was religious or 
nothing like that, but, um, I know that he was a good, a good person, and, he, he loved those kids, 
and I just don't know what, what could change his brain so drastically to go against his kids like 
that, dude, uh – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– because I'm asking myself.  There's nothing on this planet that could make me do 
that, nothing. 
 
Speaker 2: 
No. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Not a damn thing, bro.  I mean, uh, you should have seen the way he was talking to 
them, kids.  Uh, it was insane.  I'm not even kidding.  It was insane.   
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah.  I can't – 
 
Speaker 1: 
I feel so bad for them. 
 
Speaker 2: 
I'm trying to wrap my head around it as well. 
 

Speaker 1: 
Oh, everybody is. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And, you know, uh, Rick knew a lot of people out here. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, he knew a lot of, he had a lot of friends, you know, and the kids 
obviously have a lot of friends, you know, and, uh, 
 and 
 just graduated this year, and 
they are, this – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– it's, it's messed up, so what's, what's, what's the, what's the next step? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Just continue on the investigation and. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Figure out what, there's really nothing really to figure out, huh? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Well, it's everything to figure out because, I mean. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Well, what's the question?  What's, uh, you as a, as a detective, you, so your, your 
main objective is why, right? 
 
Speaker 2: 
My main objective is, uh, hmm, what are the events that led to – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Right. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– the outcome, so I have to – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Like – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– like – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– the like, uh, in, in this, in the, in this scenario starting yesterday when the fir, 
when the first police officer showed up. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Even maybe before that.  Who know – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Even maybe before that. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Well, I'll tell you – 
 

Speaker 2: 
Well I, I, uh, you – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– as a detective, you never know where things are gonna lead. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
So, I mean, you can only talk to people, follow the evidence and maybe you'll be 
able to, I mean – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Figure out – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– there is certain times where much investigating and stuff, like, you may still be 
left with question marks at the end of the day. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Hundred percent – 
 
Speaker 2: 
So – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– hundred percent. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– all I can, all we can do is, the best job we can do is trying to find, like – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Actually, I think, uh, I think the only re, the only way to really find out what his 
mindset was and what he was really thinking and why is to find out where the fuck he went, dude, 
on that river and to find out and to talk to the people that he was hanging out with. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know what I mean?  That would be the only thing because – 
 
Speaker 2: 
How was he before he left? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Not like that. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I don't think so, bro.  I mean, he might have been, he – okay, so, well, before he left, 
uh, the week before he left there might have been some issues because he left – 
 
Speaker 2: 
M'kay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– in the, in the, in the motor home.  You know what I mean?  Um, 
 the only 
one that could talk on that. 
 

Speaker 2: 
Okay. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know, and – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– I would ask her – 
 
Speaker 2: 
And I'm not the one – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– exactly. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– talking to her.  That's the other dec, detective – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
– so. 
 
Speaker 1: 
And I, I would, I would definitely ask her that question.  You know what I mean? 
 
Speaker 2: 
Mm hmm. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Why did he leave?  You know, what was up?  The, the, what was going on a couple 
weeks before him leaving in the motor home.  You know, I do know that he didn't want nothing to 
do with that family. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah.  That just – 
 
Speaker 1: 
That's the crazy – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– I can't wrap my head around that one – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah.  It's **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– especially the children, um – 
 
Speaker 1: 
**** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Beautiful great kids, dude. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
You know what I mean?  And, uh, like I said, honestly, the last 20 years I've 
watched him raise those kids.  **** she's, she's crazy.  I have watched him raise these kids like 

every wrestling match, every basketball game, football game, baseball game.  He was a coach.  He 
coached all the wrestling.  He coached football.  It's crazy, dude. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Well, I'm not gonna take up any more of your time – 
 
Speaker 1: 
No, I appreciate it, but yeah – 
 
Speaker 2: 
– I really appreciate – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– of course, of course, and if you – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Have you got my card? 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah.  If you have any questions, just call me, and I'll – 
 
Speaker 2: 
All right. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– tell, I'll tell you whatever **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
And if you can think of anything else that you think it's important for me to know, 
go ahead and reach out to me. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Well, I was thinking about this morning, and the only thing that I can, I thought that 
was kind of, um, that I thought was important that I really can't definitively say who shot the first 
shot. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Or if Rick ever shot a shot – 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah, and I don't even have – 
 
Speaker 1: 
– but you would be, yeah, but you would be able to know if, if you got his weapon. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, yeah, so – 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah, you know what I mean? 
 
Speaker 2: 
– I mean, that **** – 
 
Speaker 1: 
And **** on his, on his 'cause he had **** – 
 
Speaker 2: 
All of us play like a little bit of part, a little part in the investigation, and it's like 
once that whole picture is painted, we may not know, you know. 
 
Speaker 1: 
I sure would love to, uh, to know if he had drugs in his system, bro – 

 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 1: 
– and if you ever find out and you feel like calling me, bro. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Have a good day, sir. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
And you said go to, you said go talk to him? 
 
Speaker 1: 
 yeah. 
 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah, and go talk to 
 
 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah, absolutely. 
 
Speaker 2: 
All right. 
 
Speaker 1: 
Drive up the driveway, and he's probably sitting in his garage. 
 
Speaker 2: 
All right.  Thank you.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he is familiar with the residence, the female resident and individuals who
associate at that residence. He stated he has had several encounters prior to this call for service
with the female’s son, Christian Plancarte. Sgt. Carbajal identified Plancarte’s mother as

Sgt. Carbajal stated he had prior knowledge that Plancarte is a convicted felon and is on active
probation for a previous incident in which he (Plancarte) was arrested for an assault with a deadly
weapon against his mother, elder abuse, and residential burglary. Sgt. Carbajal stated he was also
aware of an expired stay away order Maria had against Plancarte, which Plancarte violated several
times and was arrested for.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he and Officer Hernandez responded from the Calexico Police Department
and drove out together but took different routes. He stated on his way to the call he inquired about
additional information, such as what Plancarte’s actions were. He stated there were not many
additional details other than the reporting person was hiding in the restroom and Plancarte was still
attempting to break into the residence.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he arrived at the location first and Officer Hernandez arrived a few seconds
later. He stated they parked about 3 residences to the east of the target location. Sgt. Carbajal stated
he exited his patrol unit and began walking to the target location.

He stated at this point he could hear banging and noises coming from the residence and this led
him to believe there was an active or in progress burglary occurring. Sgt. Carbajal stated by this
time Officer Hernandez was out of his patrol unit and could see and hear him (Officer Hernandez)
walking behind him.

Sgt. Carbajal stated at this point he and Officer Hernandez “double timed” it to the front of the
residence. He stated he could still hear banging and believed it was still an active situation. He
stated as he approached the front yard of the residence he illuminated the front door area of the
residence with his flashlight. Sgt. Carbajal stated he saw and recognized Plancarte actively trying
to pry open the front door.

Sgt. Carbajal stated Plancarte had his back towards him. He stated as he illuminated him with his
flashlight, Plancarte turned his body towards him and was able to see he was holding a large
crowbar.

Sgt. Carbajal stated at that point he identified himself as a Calexico Police Department officer and
had already drawn his weapon and had it at the “low ready”. He stated as he identified himself as
a police officer and he told Plancarte “What are you doing” and immediately followed with “put
it down”, referring to the crowbar.

Sgt. Carbajal stated that due to the circumstances and him having previous knowledge that
Plancarte had been violent towards his mother and law enforcement as well, he told Officer
Hernandez to switch over to his taser. Sgt. Carbajal stated he wanted to have a less lethal force
option available in case they needed it. He also stated that the reason he told Officer Hernandez to
switch to taser was in case the situation was where Plancarte did not want to put the crowbar down.

Sgt. Carbajal stated at this point Plancarte started walking towards him and had the crowbar at his
side. He stated he gave Plancarte several commands to put down the crowbar, but he raised it and
charged him.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he verbalized to Officer Hernandez “taze him” because he thought he had his
taser out and wanted to try and taze Plancarte before they had to use lethal force. Sgt. Carbajal
stated at the time Plancarte charged at him, Officer Hernandez discharged his firearm at Plancarte.
Sgt. Carbajal stated he recalls Officer Hernandez fired two or three rounds at Plancarte.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he recalls Plancarte’s body moves changing. He stated he could tell and
identify that Plancarte had been shot by the way he reacted to the rounds. Sgt. Carbajal stated at
that point Plancarte began to lower the crowbar and fell to the ground. Sgt. Carbajal stated that as
Plancarte charged at him, he (Sgt. Carbajal) had him at gunpoint and had his finger on the trigger.
He stated at that point he was pulling the trigger of his firearm to the breaking point.

Sgt. Carbajal stated that Plancarte charging at him with the crowbar was an imminent threat of
serious bodily injury to him. He stated he feared for his safety due to Plancarte’s actions and
retreated backwards in an attempt to create distance and time. He stated he had Plancarte at
gunpoint and was pulling the trigger on his firearm at the same time Officer Hernandez fired his

rounds, Sgt. Carbajal stated he was getting ready to shoot Plancarte as well when Officer
Hernandez fired his firearm. Sgt. Carbajal stated Plancarte came about ten feet from him and if it
was not for his (Sgt. Carbajal’s) retreat, he believes Plancarte would have reached him.

Sgt. Carbajal stated after Plancarte fell to the ground, he approached him and kicked the crowbar
out of his reach. He stated he immediately began to restrain Plancarte and place him in custody.
Sgt. Carbajal stated he grabbed one of Plancarte’s arm and began to handcuff him and noticed he
(Plancarte) was in pain. He stated he then secured Plancarte’s other arm and began first aid
treatment.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he identified Plancarte had been shot in the stomach area and located a second
bullet wound to Plancarte’s leg. He stated once they began administering first aid to Plancarte, they
also advised dispatch of the situation and began requesting additional resources.

Sgt. Carbajal stated Officer Hernandez went to the front door of the residence to check on
Plancarte’s mother. He stated at that point they did not know what her status was or whether
Plancarte had made entry into the residence prior to their arrival. He stated Plancarte’s mother was
not answering the door or her phone. Sgt. Carbajal stated they continued first aid on Plancarte, and
they were eventually able to make contact with Plancarte’s mother and realized she was unharmed.

Sgt. Carbajal stated additional units arrived on scene and he also requested additional resources
such as medical, additional personnel. He stated members of the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office
(ICSO) arrived to assist as well. He stated ICSO Scientific Investigations Unit (SIU) arrived to
collect evidence, and District Attorney Investigators.

DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if he had previously arrested Plancarte and he stated he had. DAI
Peraza asked him what the arrest was for, and Sgt. Carbajal stated it was for a violation of the stay
away order and for drugs. DAI Peraza then asked Sgt. Carbajal if Plancarte made any statements
when he (Sgt. Carbajal) arrived and identified himself. Sgt. Carbajal stated he believes Plancarte
did not make any statements. He stated he does not recall Plancarte making any statements, he
stated Plancarte just turned around and charged at them.

DAI Peraza then asked Sgt. Carbajal if he saw Plancarte raise the crowbar like in an attempt to hit
him or in batting position. Sgt. Carbajal stated he did see Plancarte raise the crowbar and stated he
raised the crowbar when he charged at him. Sgt. Carbajal stated Plancarte raised the crowbar in an
aggressive stance and would describe it as a baseball type batting stance.

DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal how far he was from Plancarte when he did that, and he stated he
was about twenty feet away. DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal where Officer Hernandez was when
Plancarte ran towards him. Sgt. Carbajal stated Officer Hernandez was to his left (east) and was
slightly behind him. Sgt. Carbajal stated Officer Hernandez was slightly out of his peripheral view
and about ten feet to his left (east).

AXON BODY 4 D@1A1@59X

 

DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if Officer Hernandez was providing cover for him. Sgt. Carbajal
stated that as he (Sgt. Carbajal) engaged Plancarte, Officer Hernandez was in the process of
flanking him, but everything evolved very quickly. DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if Officer
Hernandez say anything to Plancarte, like any direction or an order. Sgt. Carbajal stated he believes
Officer Hernandez gave Plancarte commands to drop the crowbar. DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal
if Officer Hernandez provided first aid to Plancarte. Sgt. Carbajal stated Officer Hernandez and
Officer Torres, who arrived after the shooting, provided the majority of the first aid to Plancarte.

I asked Sgt. Carbajal if when he stated he “doubled timed” it upon his arrival to the scene, he meant

he ran. He stated he did not run but “hustled”. Sgt. Carbajal stated when he initially got out of his

patrol unit he started walking to the residence. He stated that as he started hearing the banging he
“double timed it” he jogged.

I advised Sgt. Carbajal that earlier he stated he raised his weapon. I asked him if by this he meant
his firearm and he stated “yes”. Sgt. Carbajal stated on arrival he illuminated Plancarte with his
handheld flashlight and had already unholstered his gun and had it at the low ready. He stated as
he saw Plancarte holding the crowbar he brought his gun up.

DAI Peraza then asked Sgt. Carbajal if he saw Officer Hernandez take out his taser or if he was
aware if he (Officer Hernandez) had a chance to take his taser out. Sgt. Carbajal stated while on
scene he did not see if he took his taser out because Officer Hernandez was behind him. He stated
he thought he had taken the taser out and that is the reason he told Officer Hernandez to taze
Plancarte.

At this point Sgt. Carbajal’s attorney, Matt Gelfond, stated he had a question regarding this topic.
Mr. Gelfond asked Sgt. Carbajal when he told Officer Hernandez to taze Plancarte if he intended
that as an order to use the taser and not to shoot. Sgt. Carbajal stated that was not his intention.
Sgt. Carbajal stated he wanted to be very clear about this. He stated he believed Officer Hernandez
had his taser out and thought that was his only option, so therefore he told Officer Hernandez to
taze Plancarte. Sgt. Carbajal stated that was not an order to not shoot.

Sgt. Carbajal stated he was glad Officer Hernandez had his gun out and did what he did. Sgt.
Carbajal stated that was the only option they had left at that point. Sgt. Carbajal stated that

Plancarte charging at him within that distance and possibly striking him with the crowbar would
have caused him some serious injuries. Sgt. Carbajal stated he credits Officer Hernandez with
saving him from getting hit.

DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if he received any information Plancarte’s mother was hiding or
was in fear when initially responding to the call. Sgt. Carbajal stated he was advised that Plancarte
was actively breaking into the residence and his mother was hiding due to fear of being injured.

Sgt. Carbajal stated from having prior knowledge of both individuals, he knew Plancarte had the
potential to cause great bodily injury to his mother because he had done it in the past. He stated
that he believed a serious situation was going on.

A short time later we terminated the interview with Sgt. Carbajal.

I reviewed Sgt. Carbajal’s BWC footage before and after the interview. I found the footage to be
consistent with Sgt. Carbajal’s statement.

END OF REPORT.

identified as 30-year-old Christian Plancarte and the reporting party as his mother, 69-year-old

] had previous law enforcement encounters with Plancarte at the same residence. | knew Plancarte did not
reside at the location and was constantly trespassing onto the property. | knew Plancarte was a violent
convicted felon, on active probation for feloniously assaulting i. Plancarte had been previously arrested
on 04/13/21 for elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon against Maria (C21-05569). He had also been
arrested multiple times for violating a stay away court order protecting Maria. The stay away order has since
expired.

At 21:46 hours, | arrived on scene and parked my unit approximately three houses east of the target
residence. Seconds later, Officer Hernandez arrived on scene and parked behind my unit. | exited my unit and
began walking towards 736 Grant Street. As ] approached |] could hear banging noises coming from the target
location.

As | approached, | encountered Plancarte standing at the front door of the residence. Plancarte was holding a
large crowbar and was actively attempting to pry open the front door. | deployed my department issued
handgun and illuminated Plancarte with my hand held flashlight. | identified myself as a Calexico police officer
and ordered Plancarte to put the crowbar down.

Due to the totality of the circumstances, | instructed Officer Hernandez to deploy his department issued taser,
so a less lethal option would be immediately available, in case it was needed.

Plancarte then turned and began walking in my direction, while still holding the crowbar. | gave Plancarte
numerous commands to drop the crowbar and also verbalized to Officer Hernandez to tase Plancarte.
Plancarte suddenly raised the crowbar above his head and charged directly at me.

Fearing great bodily injury, | quickly retreated by speed walking backwards. As Plancarte continued his charge
and came within 10 feet from me, Officer Hernandez discharged three rounds from his handgun, at Plancarte.
Plancarte was struck by the gunfire and fell to ground, stopping his advance towards me. | noticed Plancarte
dropped the crowbar and | immediately approached him and kicked the crowbar away from his reach.

Calexico dispatch was advised of the situation and additional units and medical personnel were requested to
the scene.

| then handcuffed Plancarte to the front, as it was not practical to cuff his hands behind his back due to the
amount of pain he was experiencing. Officer Anthony Torres arrived on scene at about 21:50 hours. Officer
Hemandez and Officer Torres administered first aid on Plancarte. Plancarte sustained a single gunshot wound
to his abdomen and a grazing gunshot wound to his left thigh area. Calexico paramedics arrived on scene and
continued providing medical aid. Plancarte was later flown, via air ambulance, to a San Diego trauma center
for advanced medical care. Plancarte was not interviewed due to his injuries.

| then contacted a a cs emotionally upset but otherwise not injured. | then inspected the

crime scene. | noticed the residence was equipped with a front metal security door. The area surrounding the
security door handle was bent, damaged, and displayed fresh pry marks. The glass panel on the interior entry
door was also shattered. The damage to both doors was estimated at over $500.00.

Imperial County District Attorney Investigators were called out to the scene. The scene was later turned over
to lead Investigator Rafael Peraza and his team. All the evidence and photos collected from the scene were
collected and processed by the Imperial County Scientific Investigations Unit. Maria's interview was conducted
by District Attorney Investigators. Refer to Investigator Peraza's report for further information.

Based on my observations, | believe there is sufficient probable cause to sustain the charges of 664/459 PC
(Attempted Burglary), 245(a)(1) PC (Assault with a Deadly Weapon) and 594(b) (Vandalism). Plancarte was
observed actively attempting to force entry into his mother's residence with a crowbar. The front security door
and entry door were damaged in his attempts to force the doors open. Plancarte then charged at officers,
armed with a crowbar. He raised the crowbar over his head, in an attacking manner, and disobeyed multiple
commands to drop it. It's my belief that Plancarte's intention was to attack me with said crowbar for the
purpose of causing great bodily injuries.

NARRATIVE

On 11/29/2023, at approximately 2234 hours, | responded ie ona
report of domestic violence in progress. While en route to the call, dispatch advised the reporting party
and victim, who shall be referred to as OW1, reported the father of her child had punched her in the
face. OW1 had gone back inside her home, and the suspect had returned to the front door and asked
her not to call the police. Additionally, dispatch advised that the suspect was on the front porch,
slamming on the door and attempting to get the victim to open it up.

Upon my arrival, | located the suspect, later identified as Ulisses Tomas Mendoza, standing on the
front porch of the residence. Mendoza was pounding on the door and asking the victim to open it up. |
gave Mendoza loud, clear verbal commands to show me his hands and lie down on the concrete.
Mendoza did not comply with my commands and instead reached inside his pockets. | noticed while
speaking with Mendoza that he was highly intoxicated. His speech was slurred, and his gait was
unsteady. Additionally, there was an empty bottle of alcohol on the porch next to Mendoza within arms
reach. | requested additional units respond to my location and assist in taking Mendoza into custody.

Officer J. Flores and | gave Mendoza loud, clear verbal commands for approximately 3 or 4 minutes
while we waited for backup to arrive. Mendoza did not comply with our commands and continued to
put his hands inside his pockets and behind his back. Eventually, we convinced Mendoza to lie down
on the ground so he could be taken into custody. The area where Mendoza laid down was on a porch
with a very narrow entrance. The alcohol bottle was still close to Mendoza, and we decided to
approach him and drag him off the porch onto the ground to take him into custody. During the course
of Mendoza's arrest, his head struck the side of the house, causing an approximate 2' laceration over
his right eyebrow. See Officer C. Lane's supplemental report.

| immediately requested AMR respond to the scene, as well as a supervisor. | walked Mendoza out to
the front of the complex and conducted a search incident to arrest of his person.

| conducted a records check of Mendoza and found him to have no wants or warrants and was not on
probation or parole.

CSI Officer A. Torres responded to the scene and took photographs of the victim and suspect's
injuries. | then contacted the victim, OW1, inside her residence. OW1 gave me the following statement
in summary.

OW1 said she and Mendoza have two children, ages 3 and 5. OW1 said she had not consumed any
alcoholic beverages/drugs and Mendoza had been drinking that afternoon. Mendoza had approached
her in the parking lot of the apartment complex. Mendoza lives in the apartment complex,
approximately three apartments away from OW1, with his parents. Mendoza approached OW1 and
asked her, ""Do you wanna fuck my bitch?"" OW1 was confused and told Mendoza, ""What the fuck do
you mean?"" Mendoza then punched OW’ in the upper lip one time with a closed fist, causing
significant swelling and bleeding inside the mouth. OW1 ran back inside, locked her front door, and
called 911. Mendoza returned to the front porch of OW1's residence and began pounding on the door
and ringing the doorbell. Mendoza asked OW1 not to call the police.

Report # 23-110878 - Incident Report Report Cover Sheet Salinas Police Department Pg 3 of 3

 

| offered OW1 a temporary restraining order against Mendoza, and she said she wished for one. |
contacted the on-duty judge, Honorable Judge Panetta, who authorized the temporary restraining
order. | gave OW1 a copy of the restraining order and explained the terms to her. | told OW1 that if
she wished to seek an additional restraining order against Mendoza after seven days, she would need
to go to the courthouse in Monterey. OW1 told me she was familiar with the process, had a prior
domestic violence charge against Mendoza, and had had a domestic violence restraining order
against him for several years. OW71 said she had let Mendoza back into her life to try to be a father to
their two children.

| gave OW1 a domestic violence brochure, which included her victim's rights, as well as the victim's
advocate information. OW1 stated she wished to remain anonymous in the report and signed the 293
PC form.

| contacted Mendoza, who was at Natividad Medical Center for treatment of the laceration on his right
eyebrow. | read Mendoza his Miranda rights from my department-issued officer handbook. | asked
Mendoza if he understood these rights, as | had explained them to him. Mendoza could not give me a
straight answer and continued to ask unintelligible questions. | tried to get Mendoza to answer me for
several minutes, but he would not. | did not ask Mendoza any further questions about the crime he
had committed while he was in my custody. | told Mendoza he was under arrest for domestic violence
and served him with a copy of the emergency protective restraining order that the judge signed.
Mendoza made several spontaneous statements, saying, ""I did not hit that bitch."" I stood by with
Mendoza while he received approximately 7 to 8 stitches over his right eyebrow.

It should be noted that Mendoza was highly intoxicated and continued to move around on the hospital
bed, making it difficult for a doctor or nurse to provide care. Mendoza continued to ask me to take him
to jail while he was in custody and he asked me to hit him.

Eventually, | transported Mendoza to the Monterey County Jail, where he was booked for charges of
PC 273.5(a), domestic violence corporal injury on a spouse, and PC 148(a)(1), obstructing or delaying
a peace Officer.

DISPOSITION

| request a copy of this report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review
and consideration of prosecution for the aforementioned charges.

Nothing further, end of report.

NARRATIVE

Evidence

My department issued body-worn Axon camera was activated during this investigation and was
uploaded to Evidence.com.

Narrative

On 11/29/23, at 2234 hours, | responded to IEEE to assist Officers Whitmore and Officer
Flores in taking a domestic violence suspect into custody. For details regarding the incident, refer to
Officer Whitmore's narrative.

Prior to my arrival, Officer Whitmore advised he was challenging a male, later identified as Ulisses
Mendoza, at the porch of the reporting party and victims’ residence. Officer Whitmore advised that
Mendoza was not being cooperative.

Upon my arrival, | observed Mendoza laying in his stomach on the porch of BEBE. He refused
several commands for him to crawl away from the door and toward officers. It was unclear if Mendoza
was armed or if there were any weapons on the porch. From the position Mendoza was in, we were
unable to effect an arrest of Mendoza. In order to gain better control of Mendoza, take him into
custody, and prevent his escape, | took hold of his left arm and pulled him toward me away from the
porch to an open area. In the process of pulling Mendoza, his forehead struck the corner wood siding
of the residence, causing an approximate two-inch laceration to his right eyebrow. Mendoza was then
taken into custody without incident.

Medical aid was requested and AMR and Salinas Fire arrived on scene to treat Mendoza. He was
transported to Natividad Medical Center for further treatment, released and booked into jail. His
injuries were photographed by CSI Officer Torres and uploaded to evidence.com.

Disposition

This concludes my involvement in this case. | request this case be attached to Officer Whitmore's
report.

SYNOPSIS
On 11/17/2023, at approximately 1559 hours, MHPD oﬃcers received an Automated License Plate Reader notiﬁcation of a stolen white 2016 Ford 
Transit Van (CA Exempt: 1498662) traveling westbound on Cochrane Road from US 101. Oﬃcers located the vehicle and initiated a felony vehicle 
stop. The driver was uncooperative and ﬂed from oﬃcers. A pursuit was initiated and the driver eventually yielded at the dead end of a residential 
neighborhood. The driver was extremely uncooperative, made furtive movements, and attempted to re-enter the vehicle. Less lethal munitions were 
deployed and the driver was taken into custody without further incident. A records check revealed the driver, in addition to the on-viewed charges, 
had an outstanding Felony bench warrant ($20,000 bail) out of San Jose PD for 10851(a) CVC and 368(c) PC.

Narrative by Rocha , Martin 
First Submitted: 11/17/2023 20:42
PURPOSE:
To document my activity in this case.
ACTIVITY:
On 11/17/2023, at approximately 1600 hours, I was in full police uniform and driving a fully marked Morgan Hill Police 
Department (MHPD) patrol vehicle. At about this time, MHPD Dispatch advised us of a FLOCK activation of a white Ford 
Transit van (CA/1498662) that was stolen from the Berryessa Bart Station on 11/17/2023. It should be noted MHPD 
Dispatch subsequently conﬁrmed the Ford van was still listed as outstanding with Bart PD. Please refer to Bart PD’s report 
(Case# 2311-1100) for further details.  
Oﬃcer responded to the above location and circulated for the Ford van but were met with negative results. At approximately 
1617 hours, Oﬃcer Hall #272, located the Ford van traveling southbound on Butterﬁeld Blvd from Cochrane Rd. Oﬃcer Hall 
subsequently advised over the radio they had turned eastbound on Jarvis Dr, and then northbound through an alleyway 
towards Skipper Ln.
Upon my arrival, I saw Oﬃcer Hall traveling northbound through the above alleyway towards Skipper Ln, behind the Ford 
van. I directed my patrol vehicle behind Oﬃcer Hall and assisted him as a ﬁll unit. I then saw the driver of the Ford van, 
later identiﬁed as Joseph Cardoso drive around a roundabout and back towards Jarvis Dr. Joseph then drove westbound 
on Jarvis Dr, towards Butterﬁeld Blvd, but unexpectedly stopped and parked.
Joseph opened the driver door and began to argued with us. I gave Joseph approximately ﬁve or more opportunities to exit 
his vehicle, but he refused. I also informed Joseph that his failure to listen to my commands could result in force or deadly 
force used against him. However, Joseph kept arguing and refused to follow our commands. 
Joseph subsequently initiated a failure to yield and sped off westbound on Jarvis Dr, towards Butterﬁeld Blvd. It should 
be noted Oﬃcer Broyer #193 was primary in the pursuit, Oﬃcer Hall #272 was secondary and I was third. Oﬃcer Broyer 
attempted a PIT (precision immobilization technique) but was unsuccessful due to Joseph’s erratic driving. Please refer to 
Oﬃcer Hall and Oﬃcer Broyer reports for further details on the pursuit. 
It should be noted Cpl. Silva deployed his stop sticks in attempt to deﬂate/spike the tires so it could become disable. Please 
refer to Cpl. Silva’s supplement report for further details.

After Cpl. Silva spiked the Ford van, Joseph continued driving eastbound on Cochrane Rd, but came to a complete stop at 
the dead end of Golden Eagle Dr, east of White Moon Dr. Joseph exited the Ford van and became argumentative towards 
oﬃcers. Joseph was again given several commands to surrender but he refused. I also saw and heard Oﬃcer Broyer tell 
Joseph he was going to get tase, but he refused to listen.
I informed Joseph again that failure to listen to my commands could result in force or deadly force used against him, but 
he refused to not listen. Joseph had baggy clothing which prevented me from seeing any concealed weapons around his 
waistband. Joseph also kept placing his hands around his waistband and I felt unsafe because it was apparent that he had 
the ability and opportunity to hurt hurt us if he wanted to do so.
Joseph then sat on the driver’s seat and continued to argue. Joseph was again told to get on the ground, but he refused. 
Joseph stood up and pointed his ﬁnger towards oﬃcer Granado #291. I then hear Oﬃcer Hall yelled “les lethal less lethal,” 
before he subsequently deployed bean bag rounds at Joseph. It should be noted Joseph sat back on the driver seat and 
refused to exit. Please refer to Oﬃcer Hall’s report for further details.  
I then heard Sgt. Woodrow #247 used his PA system to give Joseph several commands to exit his vehicle. Joseph 
subsequently exited his vehicle and was taken into custody without incident.
Prior to clearing the scene, I spoke with a male later identiﬁed as David 
 who claimed to have heard oﬃcer give Joseph 
several commands to surrender. David provided me with the following summarized statement.
STATEMENT OF DAVID:    
David was walking on Cochrane Rd, adjacent to the residences located on the south side of Golden Eagle Dr. David said he 
heard police sirens and saw our “lights.” David said he subsequently heard an oﬃcer give commands through a speaker. 
David said he also heard a loud sound that sounded like a gunshot. David stated he heard an oﬃcer state the following:
“Non lethal.”
“Hands out the window.”
David also said the commands sounded like they were instructions for someone to comply with. David clariﬁed he did not 
witness the incident and only heard part of it.
End of statement.
I remained on scene and completed a CHP 180 form. Community Tow arrived on scene and towed/stored the vehicle per 
CVC 22651(c). I subsequently forwarded to CHP 180 form to MHPD Dispatch so they could remove the Ford van from SVS.
This oﬃcer took no further action.
DISPOSITION:
Case cleared by arrest.

SUMMARY:
On 11/17/2023, at approximately 1559 hours, MHPD oﬃcers received an Automated License Plate Reader notiﬁcation 
of a stolen white 2016 Ford Transit Van (CA Exempt: 1498662) traveling westbound on Cochrane Road from US 101. 
Oﬃcers located the vehicle and initiated a felony vehicle stop. The driver initially yielded but was uncooperative and verbally 
assaultive towards oﬃcers. The driver ﬂed from oﬃcers and a pursuit was initiated. The pursuit lasted approximately 4 
minutes and 24 seconds and covered approximately 2.76 miles. During the pursuit, the driver ran multiple red lights, drove 
on the opposite side of the road, drove above the posted speed limits, and drove with a disregard for public safety. The 
driver eventually yielded at the dead end of a residential neighborhood and stepped out of the vehicle. He continued to 
disobey lawful orders, made furtive movements, refused to show oﬃcers his hands, and re-entered the vehicle. Less lethal 
munitions were deployed and the driver was taken into custody without further incident. He was identiﬁed as JOSEPH 
CARDOSA. JOSEPH, in addition to the on-viewed charges, had an outstanding Felony bench warrant ($20,000 bail) out of 
San Jose PD for 10851(a) CVC and 368(c) PC. The warrant was conﬁrmed and JOSEPH was placed under arrest. He was 
transported to 
 where he was admitted. JOSEPH was issued a Notice to Appear for the warrant 
and released to hospital staff pursuant to 849(a) PC for the on-viewed offenses.
DISPOSITION:
Case forwarded to DA for review.
ADDITIONAL CHARGES:
• 10851(a) CVC – vehicle theft
• 496d(a) PC – possession of a stolen vehicle
• 2800.2(a) CVC – evading a peace oﬃcer with wanton disregard for public safety
• 2800.4 CVC – evading a peace oﬃcer, wrong-way driving
• 148(a)(1) PC – delay, resist, obstruct a peace oﬃcer
• 12022.1(b) PC – committing a secondary felonious offense while on bail
INJURIES:
JOSEPH sustained moderate injuries to his face/jaw region
JOSEPH sustained a contusion to his chest region
NARRATIVE:
On 11/17/2023, at approximately 1559 hours, MHPD oﬃcers received an Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) notiﬁ-
cation of a stolen white 2016 Ford Transit Van (CA Exempt: 1498662) traveling westbound on Cochrane Road from US 101.
According to the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS) notiﬁcation, the vehicle belonged to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and was 
taken from the Berryessa BART station in San Jose, CA on the same day (11/17/2023). Refer to BART PD Case: 2311-110 
for further details.
Oﬃcers canvassed the area for the vehicle for approximately 15 minutes. At 1617 hours I located the vehicle traveling 
westbound on Cochrane Road. I informed MHPD dispatchers and responding oﬃcers that I had located the vehicle and 
followed it as it turned southbound onto Butterﬁeld Blvd.

I continued following the vehicle, without activating my patrol vehicle’s emergency lights and siren, as it turned eastbound 
onto Jarvis Drive. While following the vehicle, I noticed the vehicle was traveling at a low rate of speed (approximately 25-30 
mph in a 45-mph zone). Based on my training and experience, I recognized this driving behavior to be a common tactic for 
a driver of a vehicle that is involved in criminal activity. Often, a driver will drive slowly while looking for a chance to exit 
the vehicle and ﬂee on foot, or the driver is attempting to determine if the police are actively following them. Based on my 
training and experience, I knew that subjects driving stolen vehicles will often carry weapons or engage in a pursuit and with 
that information in the forefront of my mind I wanted to allow time for additional units to respond to my location to assist 
with a high-risk felony car stop. I also knew that oﬃcers in the area were setting up spike strips/stop sticks at strategic 
locations to bring a pursuit to a quick resolution further enhancing the safety of our community, the driver of the stolen 
vehicle, and the responding oﬃcers.
As I continued following the vehicle, I could see that the driver appeared to be a Hispanic Male Adult, approximately 35 years 
old, with a bald head. It appeared the driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle.
I continued following the vehicle as it turned northbound onto Skipper Lane. The driver continued driving at a very slow 
speed as it approached a roundabout on Skipper Lane, between Cochrane Road and Jarvis Drive. The driver bypassed three 
exits in the roundabout making a full 180-degree turn, southbound on Skipper Lane. Based on those observations and the 
decision to make a full 180-degree turn on the roundabout it was apparent to me that the driver was now aware he was 
being followed by a marked police vehicle. Due to the limited traﬃc on Jarvis Drive and Skipper Lane it was not possible for 
me to be discreet while attempting to follow the stolen vehicle as I was in a large Ford Explorer painted black and white with 
police lights and decals on all sides. That information immediately created an advantage for the driver of the stolen vehicle 
as I was now going to be forced to react to whatever action he made. As we exited Skipper Lane back onto westbound 
Jarvis Drive I saw Oﬃcer Rocha arrive and pull along side me.
The driver of the stolen vehicle elected to stop his vehicle on the north side of Jarvis Drive, facing west, which forced me 
to respond. Based on my training and experience I know that suspects involved in criminal behaviors will often attempt 
to ambush oﬃcers when it becomes obvious that they cannot avoid police contact. I have watched police videos and 
attended police training where I was exposed to vehicular ambushes. I was concerned that the driver of this stolen vehicle 
was attempting to do the very same thing and recognized that the most appropriate response to an occupied stolen vehicle 
was a high-risk felony car stop. I immediately activated my patrol vehicle’s emergency overhead lights and manual siren 
to alert the driver of the stolen vehicle that the Morgan Hill Police Department were now detaining him. I exited my patrol 
vehicle to conduct a high-risk vehicle stop along with Oﬃcer Rocha #287. Oﬃcer Rocha was in a better position to give 
verbal commands as he was angled towards the driver’s side door. I heard Oﬃcer Rocha give multiple commands to include 
a Use of Force Admonishment pursuant to 835a PC.
Immediately after activating my lights and siren, the driver of the vehicle opened the driver door. Based on my training and 
experience, I recognized this to be a “pre-ﬂight indicator” commonly displayed by criminals who plan to run from oﬃcers, 
or plan to ambush/assault oﬃcers. I have made thousands of car stops and have been involved in more than a hundred 
high-risk felony car stops. Opening the door of a vehicle immediately upon police contact is not a common behavior of 
people who have been stopped by the police for a regular/low key traﬃc violation. Based on my own training and experience 
I know that opening a door is a typical behavior associated to a person harboring criminal or nefarious intent. This speciﬁc 
behavior prompted Oﬃcer Rocha #287 and I to give the driver clear commands to show oﬃcers his hands and comply with 
our lawful and simple commands. The driver appeared to have something in his left hand which was later determined to 
be pieces of paper.

Oﬃcer Rocha #287 began giving further commands to put his hands up in the air, which the driver failed to obey. Oﬃcer 
Rocha #287 then gave the driver an admonition, stating that if he did not comply with oﬃcers’ commands, that force, 
including lethal force may be used against him.
Oﬃcer Rocha #287 continued giving the driver commands and the driver continued his refusal to comply. During the 
duration of the contact, the driver was yelling “No, no, no” and something laden with profanity which were non-sensical/un-
intelligible. At one point, Oﬃcer Rocha #287 told the driver, “I’ll explain what’s going on.” The driver responded back by 
stating, “No, I’m gonna explain what’s going on.” This indicated that the driver could clearly hear oﬃcer’s commands during 
the contact and was willfully disobeying our commands. As Oﬃcer Rocha #287 continued giving lawful commands to the 
driver, he began yelling, “NO! NO! NO! NO!”
I knew, based on my training and experience, the driver’s bizarre and aggressive behavior was another indication that he 
did not plan to comply with our commands. He had been offered de-escalation and refused to accept. De-escalation is 
always a police oﬃcers ﬁrst attempt at compliance, while maintaining oﬃcer and community safety as a priority; however, 
de-escalation is only a tool that police can offer. We cannot force a person to accept that offer and it is their actions and 
intent which ultimately determine the route the police contact will take.
After approximately 30 seconds of offering de-escalation through time, space, simple verbal commands, admonishments 
of what may happen if the commands were ignored, and ample opportunity to submit to the lawful authority of the police, 
the driver refused them all and closed the driver’s side door of the vehicle and ﬂed westbound toward Butterﬁeld Blvd. 
Oﬃcer Broyer #193 initiated a pursuit as the primary positioned oﬃcer while I took the secondary position and provided 
radio updates. Oﬃcer Rocha #287 took the third position in the pursuit. Refer to Oﬃcer Broyer #193’s narrative for further 
details involving the vehicle pursuit.
After approximately 4 minutes the stolen car was driving eastbound on Cochrane Rd towards Sutter Blvd when Cpl. Silva 
#153 successfully deployed spike strips/stop sticks to bring the pursuit to a safe termination. The stolen vehicle continued 
eastbound towards the US 101 freeway. I believed the vehicle would merge onto US 101 in an attempt to escape as that 
was not only the easiest and fastest escape route, it was also the most common for all vehicle pursuits; however, when the 
vehicle continued further east on Cochrane Rd I knew it was heading for a high pedestrianized area. The Target shopping 
complex was busy with pedestrian foot traﬃc on the Friday before Thanksgiving and at the end of the workday. The vehicle 
continued eastbound past Target and towards a residential neighborhood. This was also a great concern for police as the 
area was not only residential but ﬁlled with families and potential for greater injury or victimization of innocent community 
members. The pursuit ultimately ended at the eastern dead end of Golden Eagle Drive, in front of 1400 Golden Eagle Drive. 
Upon termination of the pursuit, the driver drove the vehicle onto the sidewalk and front yard of 1400 Golden Eagle Drive. The 
front bumper of the vehicle was positioned approximately 5 feet away from a barbed wire fence, approximately 4 feet tall, 
which separated a large ﬁeld from the housing development on Golden Eagle Drive. Based on my training and experience, 
I knew that, if the driver decided to ﬂee in the vehicle a second time, he could easily damage the fence by hitting it with the 
vehicle and would likely be able to drive through the ﬁeld, back onto Cochrane Road. Another possible escape route for the 
driver included driving through the wooden fence on the south side of 1400 Golden Eagle Dr and into the backyard of the 
resident’s home. I knew police could not allow the driver to, once again, engage police in a pursuit and continue endangering 
the community should he attempt to drive from the area.
Oﬃcer Broyer #193 positioned his patrol vehicle behind the suspect vehicle, and I positioned my patrol vehicle north of the 
suspect vehicle with a parked, uninvolved, vehicle in between us (it was a red Jeep). I made that determination to limit the 
possible escape routes for the suspect of the stolen vehicle and end any further attempt to continue ﬂeeing. The driver 
immediately swung open the driver’s side door and jumped out of the stolen vehicle. I exited my patrol vehicle and directed 
my department-issued pistol toward the suspect as he stood outside of the vehicle next to the opened driver door. I utilized

the engine compartment of my patrol vehicle as cover and, from my vantage point, I had a clear, unobstructed view of the 
suspect as he stood next to the stolen vehicle.
I immediately noticed the suspect was a tall Hispanic male, approximately 6’2”, and noticed he had a trimmed, muscular 
build. The male appeared to be approximately 30-35 years old and he appeared to be very ﬁt. I also noticed the male was 
screaming unintelligible statements which appeared to be challenging in nature. The male appeared to be extremely irate 
and, based on my training and experience, he appeared to be attempting to bait oﬃcers into a confrontation. I believed, 
based on my training and experience, that the male would likely cause me and or other oﬃcers physical harm if force-options 
were not utilized as he continued to ramp himself up emotionally and physically. I also noticed the male appeared to be 
wearing a large, bulky sweatshirt that covered the waistband of his baggy sweatpants. Based on my training and experience, 
I am aware that the waistband region is the most common area in which weapons are concealed on suspects.
I heard Oﬃcer Broyer #193, Oﬃcer Granado #291, and Oﬃcer Rocha #287 continuing to offer de-escalation to the suspect 
by giving commands and use of force admonishments. I observed the suspect as he was “painted” by lasers from Oﬃcer 
Broyer #193 and Oﬃcer Granado #291’s TASER devices. To be painted by a laser is yet another form of de-escalation taught 
to oﬃcers as another visual tool and attempt to gain wilfull compliance from a subject. The hope is that the visual of the 
red and green dots on the subject will help them recognize the likelihood of being TASED and encourage them to submit to 
the lawful authority of the police without forcing us to engage further with greater physical action.
The suspect continued to disobey commands and made frequent gestures with his hands. The suspect then began reaching 
toward his waistband and into his pocket. Based on my training and experience, I believed the suspect was searching for 
something on his person and that was most likely going to be a weapon. 
The suspect stood outside of the vehicle, approximately 6-12 inches away from the vehicle and had immediate access to 
the vehicle and its contents. Based on the fact that this suspect had already ﬂed from one high-risk vehicle stop and led 
oﬃcers on a vehicle pursuit which endangered the public, I believed that, if he was not immediately apprehended, it was 
extremely likely that he would attempt to ﬂee a second time, further endangering the public, himself and responding police 
oﬃcers. A continued vehicle pursuit would be dangerous; however, a foot pursuit also presented a new set of risk factors. 
The suspect could attempt to run towards the residence at 1400 Golden Eagle Dr which would change the backdrop for 
oﬃcers and severely limit their ability to respond to any lethal threat. If the homeowner, or a child, from that residence 
exited, which they did shortly after the successful arrest of the suspect, they would be in imminent danger of becoming 
part of this event. A foot pursuit through the ﬁeld would likely result in injury to the suspect and oﬃcers as the ﬁeld was not 
ﬂat and the long grass presented many hidden hazards. There were also homes on the other side of the ﬁeld which created 
the additional problem of maintaining the neighbor’s safety and security while attempting to subdue a ﬂeeing suspect 
through a tall grassy ﬁeld while not knowing what weapons he had on his person and what violent history/criminal intent 
he possessed.
Based on the proximity of the suspect to the vehicle and his failure to listen to oﬃcers' commands to create distance 
between him and the vehicle, it was apparent the suspect wanted to remain close to the vehicle. Additionally, based on 
my training and experience, I was aware that suspects who are armed with weapons will typically conceal the weapons on 
their person, or in their associated vehicles. Based on my training and experience, I knew the suspect could easily access 
a concealed weapon from inside the vehicle if he re-entered the vehicle, which could have caused death or serious bodily 
injury to oﬃcers or nearby residents.
Based on all of the above-mentioned actions and behaviors of the suspect, in addition to my training and experience, I 
believed that, if the suspect was allowed to re-enter the vehicle, he would pose an imminent threat to oﬃcers and the public 
that would need to be immediately addressed.

I knew Oﬃcer Rocha was on scene and provided lethal coverage which was why I re-entered my patrol vehicle and armed 
myself with my department-issued less-than-lethal Mossburg 500 12-gauge shotgun (Serial: K662467). The shotgun was 
loaded with 12-guage less-than-lethal “bean-bag” rounds and is utilized at the Morgan Hill Police Department solely for the 
purposes of deploying less-than-lethal munitions.
There were many unknown factors to consider at the time of this rapidly evolving event.
• Who the driver was and why he ﬂed from the police.
• What his criminal history was or his propensity for violence.
• Why he refused to accept all offers of de-escalation.
• What weapons he had on his person or inside the vehicle.
• How likely he was to use weapons against oﬃcers or force oﬃcers to use their weapons on him (suicide by cop)
Understanding the nature of such rapidly evolving events I also recognized the following was happening and failing to take 
action would most likely result in a greater Use of Force to effect this arrest:
• The driver was lawfully detained and would be placed under arrest.
• The driver was not compliant with oﬃcers.
• The driver jumped out of his vehicle to force a confrontation with oﬃcers and that was not typical behavior.
• The driver would not follow commands to keep his hands where oﬃcers could see them.
• The driver repeatedly reached into his front pants pockets, which is where police oﬃcers know many criminal actors 
carry their ﬁrearms.
• The longer a confrontation continues between a combative subject and the police the greater the likelihood of a 
substantial use of force or deadly force used by or against police.
I then requested approval from Sergeant Woodrow #247 over the radio to deploy the less-than-lethal bean bag rounds, if 
necessary. Sergeant Woodrow #247 approved my request. Simultaneously, I observed the suspect make furtive gestures 
towards oﬃcers who were positioned behind the stolen vehicle. He then began to turn his back to the suspect vehicle in 
a movement which would be consistent with someone who was preparing to sit down in the driver’s seat. Based on the 
totality of the circumstances, I determined the suspect was an imminent threat that needed to be immediately addressed. 
I deployed one bean-bag less-than-lethal round, aiming for the preferred target area, his abdomen, striking the suspect on 
his upper right chest. The suspect then sat down in the driver’s seat, closed the door, and began rolling up the driver’s side 
window with his left hand. That was not the desired effect of the less-than-lethal round, nor was it typical behavior of a 
subject who had decided to be complaint with oﬃcers and stop resisting. His actions were consistent with a suspect who 
was making the willful and knowing decision to continue engaging with police oﬃcers. Based on my training and experience 
it is in those split-seconds moments immediately following the deployment of a less-than-lethal option that a suspect will 
either submit to the lawful authority of the police or will make the determination that they will continue to ﬁght or engage, 
quite possibly to the death or serious bodily injury of anyone they can hurt (including themselves on occasion).
Simultaneously, the suspect began reaching around inside the vehicle towards the passenger side which was out of the 
view of all oﬃcers on scene. That presented an additional immediate threat to oﬃcers as that was one of the most likely 
areas the suspect would have been concealing a ﬁrearm or other explosive device if he had one in arm’s reach. As oﬃcers 
could not wait to see if he was reaching for a ﬁrearm or other contrivance to cause serious bodily injury or death and 
destruction, I made the determination to continue engaging with the suspect and not allow him the opportunity to arm 
himself, use the vehicle, or anything inside the vehicle as a weapon. I gave another verbal warning in the hopes that the 
suspect would stop making those furtive movements inside the vehicle and submit to the lawful arrest; however, in that 
split-second decision-making situation, I saw that he was not complying and was continuing to move and attempted to roll

up the windows barricading himself inside the vehicle. I saw an opportunity to strike a preferred target area, his upper left 
scapula (rear shoulder) and deployed a second less-than-lethal bean-bag round which appeared to go completely through 
the opened portion of the window of the driver door, past the suspect, and out of the passenger-side window. The driver 
continued to roll-up the window of the driver’s side door and continued reaching into the passenger side of the vehicle. I saw 
another opportunity to strike the same area (upper left scapula) and deployed a third less-than-lethal bean-bag round which 
traveled through the glass window. The tempered glass window shattered and I was unable to see the suspect through the 
broken glass.
I then observed the driver kick the broken glass window out with his feet, removing the glass and giving me a clear view of 
him. It appeared that the bean-bag round ultimately struck the suspect on the left side of his face after traveling through 
the window. The suspect then chose compliance and stopped all furtive movements, stopped reaching around inside the 
vehicle, and listened to the lawful commands of oﬃcers on scene.
At the same time Sergeant Woodrow #247 arrived on scene and used his in-car loud speaker to give additional verbal 
commands to the suspect. See Sergeant Woodrow’s report for further information. The suspect listened to Sergeant 
Woodrow’s instructions and exited the vehicle with his hands in the air. He was taken into custody without further incident. 
Oﬃcers rendered aid to the suspect and Sergeant Woodrow #247 requested Morgan Hill Fire Department and Santa Clara 
County EMS respond to the scene for further medical treatment.
The male was verbally identiﬁed as JOSEPH. His identity was conﬁrmed with a recent booking photograph and a records 
check revealed he had an outstanding $20,000 bail felony bench warrant out of San Jose PD for 10851(a) CVC – vehicle 
theft, and 368(c) PC – elder abuse. MHPD Dispatchers contacted SJPD and conﬁrmed the warrant was still active. JOSEPH 
was placed under arrest for the warrant, and the following on-viewed charges:
• 10851(a) CVC - Vehicle theft
• 496d(a) PC - Possession of a stolen vehicle
• 2800.2(a) CVC - evading a peace oﬃcer with wanton disregard for public safety
• 2800.4 CVC – evading a peace oﬃcer, wrong-way driving
• 148(a)(1) PC – delay, resist, obstruct a peace oﬃcer
JOSEPH was transported to 
 in San Jose, CA by SCC EMS. MSO Hayes #302 followed the 
ambulance and maintained custody of JOSEPH.
Oﬃcer Broyer #193 processed the vehicle and Oﬃcer Rocha #287 completed a CHP 180 for the vehicle recovery. Refer to 
Oﬃcer Broyer #193 and Oﬃcer Rocha #287’s report narratives for further details regarding their involvement with this case.
MHPD Dispatchers later removed the vehicle from the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS).
Sergeant Woodrow #247, Corporal Silva #153, and Oﬃcer Granado #291 canvassed the area for witnesses and video 
surveillance footage of the incident. Refer to their report narratives for further details regarding their involvement with this 
case.
Community Towing responded to the scene to tow and store the vehicle.
Oﬃcer Rocha #287 collected the three “spent” less-than-lethal bean-bag shells and provided them to me on scene. I later 
booked the spent shells into MHPD Evidence.

admitted to the hospital for further medical treatment. MSO Huddleston #268 issued JOSEPH a Notice to Appear (NTA) 
for the warrant and released him pursuant to 849(a) PC.
I later requested MHPD Dispatchers conduct a complete criminal history check of JOSEPH. This check revealed JOSEPH 
had been arrested three times since August of 2023. These arrests were as follows:

PURPOSE: To document my activity in this case.
 
ACTIVITY: On 11-17-23 at approximately 1559 hours, I, Morgan Hill Police Department (MHPD) Oﬃcer Broyer was on routine 
patrol in a marked police vehicle #153 and in full uniform in the area of Jarvis Drive at Butterﬁeld Blvd in the City of Morgan 
Hill. MHPD Communications advised of an Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) hit (CA Exempt license # 1498662
), in the area of east bound Cochrane Road at Hwy 101. MHPD Communications advised the vehicle was a white Ford 
Transit Van with “Bart BA” sticker on the driver side door. Dispatch also advised the vehicle was conﬁrmed stolen from the 
Berryessa Bart Station associated to BART PD (Case # 2311-1100).
I began circulating the area of the Target Shopping Center located at 1061 Cochrane Road to attempt to locate the stolen 
vehicle with negative results.
At approximately 1617 hours, Oﬃcer Hall advised via radio that he located the stolen vehicle in the area of west bound 
Cochrane Road at Butterﬁeld Blvd and was going to follow the vehicle until additional oﬃcers arrived on scene.
I responded to the area and overheard Oﬃcer Hall advise they were conducting a felony vehicle stop on west bound Jarvis 
Drive at Skipper Lane and the vehicle was occupied by one bald Hispanic male adult. I arrived on scene and positioned my 
patrol vehicle on the left side of Oﬃcer Rocha’s patrol vehicle. Oﬃcer Rocha and Oﬃcer Hall were giving verbal commands

and the suspect proceeded to ﬂee in the vehicle west bound on Jarvis Drive towards Butterﬁeld Blvd in violation of 148(a)(1) 
PC.
I immediately got back into my patrol vehicle and pursued after the suspect with my overhead lights / siren activated. It 
should be noted that my Axon Body Camera and Dash Camera was activated throughout the incident as I was in the number 
one position during the pursuit.
The suspect went through the posted stop sign at Butterﬁeld Blvd without stopping in violation of 22450(a) CVC- Stop 
Sign and continued north bound towards Cochrane Road. The suspect vehicle proceeded east bound on Cochrane Road at 
approximately 35 mph in the number two lane. Due to the vehicle’s slow speed, I immediately accelerated to the right of the 
vehicle in the number three lane and requested permission from Sergeant Woodrow # 247 to initiate a pursuit intervention 
technique “PIT” maneuver in attempt to spin the vehicle out to end the pursuit. As Sergeant Woodrow gave authorization 
to “PIT” the vehicle, we began approaching heavy traﬃc at Sutter Blvd. The vehicle proceeded to make a left hand turn onto 
north bound Sutter Blvd through a sold red arrow in violation of 21453(c) CVC- Red Light.
Due to my knowledge of the area of Sutter Blvd being a Business District with minimal vehicular / pedestrian traﬃc, I rapidly 
accelerated after the suspect vehicle to get in position in attempt to conduct a “PIT” maneuver as the vehicle was traveling 
approximately 30 mph. As I got close to the suspect vehicle, the suspect abruptly slammed on his brakes causing me to 
take evasive action to avoid a collision. I attempted to PIT the vehicle on the passenger side rear of the vehicle without 
success.
The vehicle continued through another posted stop sign at Woodview Avenue in violation of 22450(a) CVC- Stop Sign and 
failed to drive on the right side of the roadway in violation of 21651(b) CVC. The vehicle continued west bound on Woodview 
Avenue towards Cochrane Road and I observed the driver make numerous hand gestures out of the driver side window as 
if he was “simulating a gun”. The vehicle then proceeded through the solid red light onto west bound Cochrane Road in 
violation of 21453(a) CVC.
The pursuit continued west bound on Cochrane Road towards Monterey Road at approximately 60 mph, the vehicle made 
an illegal u-turn in the intersection at Monterey Road and continued east bound on Cochrane Road at approximately 50 
mph.
The vehicle went through the solid red lights at the intersections of Cochrane Circle and Skipper Lane in violation of 21453(a) 
CVC. It should be noted that the suspect began throwing what appeared to be trash outside the driver side window. As 
the suspect vehicle reached the intersection of Cochrane Road at Sutter Butterﬁeld Blvd, Corporal Silva #153 successfully 
deployed spike strips in the number two causing the driver side rear tire to deﬂate.
The suspect vehicle drove between two vehicles stopped in traﬃc just east of Madrone Parkway and proceeded in the right 
hand turn lane to the south bound on-ramp of Hwy 101. The vehicle swerved back across onto east bound Cochrane Road 
and went through the solid red light at the intersection of the north bound Hwy 101 off-ramp in violation of 21453(a) CVC.
As the vehicle approached the intersection of Mission View Drive, the suspect purposely drove into the west bound lanes 
of Cochrane Road and drove directly towards the front end of a FedEx truck causing the driver to swerve out of the way 
in violation of 21651(b) CVC- Fail to driver right side of roadway and 23103(a) CVC- “Reckless driving-in willful or wanton 
disregard for the safety of persons or property on highway/roadway.”
The suspect vehicle made a left hand turn onto north bound White Moon and turned right into the dead end of Golden Eagle 
Drive. The suspect vehicle drove up onto the sidewalk and into the side yard of 1400 Golden Eagle Drive and came to a 
stop. I drove the front of my patrol vehicle up against the back bumper of the suspect vehicle to prevent the suspect from 
ﬂeeing the scene again.

I immediately exited my patrol vehicle, drew my department issued ﬁrearm and pointed it at the direction of the male suspect 
as he exited the driver side door. I gave the suspect multiple commands to get his hands up in the air and he refused to 
comply. The suspect was extremely agitated, began waiving his hands around, yelling back at oﬃcers on scene and began 
reaching towards his left front pant pocket. It should be noted that it was unknown if the suspect possessed any weapons 
on his person or inside the vehicle.
I observed Oﬃcer Rocha #287 come up from my left side and he also had his department issued ﬁrearm deployed so I 
immediately transitioned to my department issued taser. I activated my taser and was aiming the red / green laser at the 
suspect’s chest and leg area in attempt to further de-escalate the suspect while giving additional commands. The suspect 
failed to comply with the oﬃcers’ commands, and he began sitting back down on the driver seat. Moments later, the suspect 
stood back up in the doorway and I overheard Oﬃcer Hall give a loud announcement, “Less Lethal, Less Lethal”. Oﬃcer Hall 
ﬁred the ﬁrst round, which hit the suspect in the front torso area and the suspect retreated into the vehicle and he closed 
the door. The area where I was standing, I was unable to get a clear view of the suspect inside the vehicle. I then heard the 
second shot from the Less Lethal shotgun and the suspect began rolling up the driver side window. I then heard the third 
shot that broke out the driver side window. I observed the suspect begin kicking out the driver side window with his feet 
while Sergeant Woodrow took over verbal commands on the loudspeaker.  After approximately two minutes, the suspect 
ﬁnally complied with commands and exited the vehicle with his hands up facing away towards the vehicle.
Corporal Silva and I approached the suspect, and I placed him in handcuffs without further incident. I observed that the 
suspect who was later identiﬁed as (AR) JOSEPH CARDOSO was bleeding from the left side of his face / cheek area and 
was notiﬁed that EMS was enroute to provide medical treatment.
MSO Hayes stayed with (AR) JOSEPH while I began taking digital photographs of the scene and vehicle with my department 
issued cellphone. I located a laptop computer and California Driver License belonging to (AR) JOSEPH on the driver side 
ﬂoor board.
The front passenger seat contained a black/grey backpack, multicolored bag with camels and designs along with a black 
suitcase. All the bags contained indicia belonging to (AR) JOSEPH. I secured all the property inside my patrol vehicle, which 
was later booked into MHPD Evidence Room for safekeeping.
While I was processing the driver side of the vehicle, I observed drops of blood on the ground along with broken glass. I 
then located two teeth on the ground with the broken glass and another tooth on the driver side door jam. I took digital 
photographs, which were uploaded to Evidence.com.
I notiﬁed the Rural Metro Paramedic of my ﬁndings, and he collected the teeth to be transported with (AR) JOSEPH to the 
hospital.
While at the scene, I took a measurement utilizing a steel measuring tape from the area where Oﬃcer Hall was standing 
when he deployed the “Less Lethal” shotgun to the driver compartment area where (AR) JOSEPH was located. The total 
distance was approximately 25 feet.
While at MHPD, I began processing the bags belonging to (AR) JOSEPH and I located a Passport and “Golden State 
Advantage” card belonging to JESSICA 
.
I took photographs of the property and booked the documents into MHPD Evidence.
It should be noted that the total distance of the pursuit was approximately 2.76 miles.

ACTIVITY: On 11/17/2023, I was in uniform driving marked patrol vehicle 168. At approximately 1600 hours, I attached 
myself to a license plate reader hit on a stolen Ford Transit van with exempt plates driving eastbound on Cochrane Rd at 
Hwy 101. At approximately 1618 hours, Oﬃcer Hall located the stolen vehicle on Jarvis Ave near Skipper Ln. I responded 
to Cochrane Rd at Sutter Ave to set up my vehicle on the south side shoulder of Cochrane Rd for a stop stick deployment 
(Stop sticks serial #SSR22040017). I informed dispatch at approximately 1621 hours; spikes were set up at my location. 
 A pursuit was initiated and at approximately 1624 hours, I observed the white Ford Transit driving eastbound in lane #1 on 
Cochrane Rd passing Wood view Ave. I saw patrol vehicles with emergency equipment activated behind the Ford.  Traﬃc 
was moderate in this area and traﬃc in lane #3 stopped as I entered the lane. I saw no traﬃc in lanes 1 & 2 as vehicles were 
yielding to emergency vehicles. I threw out the spikes between lanes #1 & 2. My BWC captured the suspect driving the Ford 
Transit and it appeared he drove over the spikes breaking the string with the reel I was holding. I retrieved the spikes and 
heard patrol units were eastbound on Cochrane Rd near Depaul Dr.
I activated my emergency equipment as units were on a high-risk car stop on Golden Eagle Dr at White Moon Dr. I arrived, 
unlatched my less lethal weapon and grabbed the barrier shield from the supervisor's vehicle. I heard Sgt Woodrow 
broadcasted de-escalation commands at the driver JOSEPH CARDOSO who was complying. I approached (AR) CARDOSO 
with other Oﬃcers and he was handcuffed. I observed a facial injury to (AR) CARDOSO as I was speaking to him, and it was 
captured on my BWC. (AR) CARDOSO was verbally identiﬁed and provided medical treatment. 
Crime scene tape blocked off the area and I canvassed the area for witnesses. I contacted the residence at 1401 Golden 
Eagle Dr which faces south and was directly across the street from the ﬁnal stop of the Ford Transit. I contacted (WI) 
 who provided me with the following statement.
STATEMENT OF (WI) CHRISTINE 
  She was home alone, only adult home at the time and was watching 3 
small children. She heard sirens and walked closer to the front door looking out the window. She heard popping noises and

thought of a gun. (WI) 
 said she saw the driver inside the vehicle with a window broken.  She heard commands 
from Oﬃcers saying, ""come out of the car, we'll get you medical attention.""  She did not see or hear any other commands. 
END OF INTERVIEW.  
After speaking to (WI) CHRISTINE, I canvassed the area and observed several subjects standing at White Moon Dr at Golden 
Eagle Dr. I spoke to (WI) 
 who indicated he witnessed part of the incident. I obtained the following statement from 
him.
STATEMENT OF (WI) MICHAEL 
 (WI) 
 was upstairs, in the 2nd story home in his home oﬃce room which faces 
east toward White Moon Dr and Golden Eagle Dr, in an unobstructed north-east view for him. (WI) 
 heard many sirens 
which is not normal, but they do have many elderly people in the neighborhood, and he indicated he hears ambulance sirens 
from time to time. 
He looked out the window and saw the white vehicle with police cars in pursuit. He initially thought the vehicle continued 
down White Moon Dr. He then realized the vehicle turned right on Golden Eagle Dr and could see the vehicle which was 
partially blocked by a black vehicle in a driveway to a residence on Golden Eagle. His window was closed, but he clearly 
saw 2 Oﬃcers with 9mm guns, and another Oﬃcer holding what looked like a brown color shotgun.
He heard a lot of commands and saw him (CARDOSO) standing outside the vehicle. He reiterated for about 15 seconds 
he saw the (CARDOSO), describing he could mainly see his head which was bald. At some point (WI) 
 opened the 
window to hear what was going on. He remembered hearing, ""turn around keep your hands up/visible."" He heard rounds, 
thinks 3 rounds that either came from a ﬁrearm or Taser. He no longer saw (CARDOSO) standing and wasn't sure if he went 
back into the vehicle. (WI) 
 believes (CARDOSO) was maybe inside the vehicle when the rounds went off but wasn't 
sure.  He said, his wife was crying and scared, he got his jacket on to come outside, and it appeared the situation with the 
police and (CARDOSO) ended to a safe conclusion. (WI) 
 saw no wrongdoing by the Police. END OF INTERVIEW.
I did not locate any other witnesses and crime tape was taken down. No further activity by this Oﬃcer. 
DISPOSITION: Case cleared by arrest.

First Submitted: 11/18/2023 17:37
PURPOSE:
To document my activity in this report. 
 
SUMMARY:
On 11/17/2023 (Friday), at approximately 1617 hrs, I (Sergeant Woodrow #247) was wearing my full Morgan Hill Police 
Department (MHPD) uniform and driving a fully marked MHPD vehicle (#165) when I responded to the area of Jarvis Dr 
and Butterﬁeld Blvd on report of a high-risk felony car stop on a stolen vehicle. 
As I was enroute I heard the vehicle ﬂed from oﬃcers attempt to make the arrest on Jarvis Dr. I stopped my vehicle on Main 
Ave at Butterﬁeld Blvd to deploy spike strips/stop sticks as the vehicle may have chose to drive southbound on Butterﬁeld 
Blvd. I was set up when I heard the vehicle travel in the opposite direction. I got back inside my vehicle and responded to a 
closer position.
I heard the vehicle was driving towards Monterey Rd on Cochrane Rd and I drove westbound on Jarvis Dr to Monterey Rd 
to set spikes and prevent a stolen vehicle ﬂeeing towards the downtown area.
The vehicle made an unexpected U-turn at Monterey Rd and Cochrane Rd traveling eastbound again. I sent a unit to the 
US 101 ramp to set spikes and heard Cpl. Silva was set at Sutter Blvd and Cochrane Rd. Cpl. Silva stopped traﬃc and 
successfully and safely deployed spike strips into the #2 lane of eastbound Cochrane Rd at Sutter Blvd. The rear driver's 
side tire hit the spike strips and started to deﬂate. 
I heard the vehicle pursuit continue onto Golden Eagle Dr and I requested MHPD Communications advise me of the ""C side"" 
which is recognized in policing as the street adjacent to the target location. The purpose of the ""C side"" is to set a perimeter 
and prevent a foot pursuit or continued chase. As I arrived on scene I saw that the ""C side"" was an open ﬁeld and not a good 
location for me to drive so I pulled into Golden Eagle Dr to assist with the apprehension of the suspect and to supervise the 
scene. 
As I arrived I saw multiple residents and children in the street and potentially in danger as we did not know what weapons 
the suspect had. Based on my training and experience, I knew one of the most dangerous circumstances for police oﬃcers 
is when they are forced to take a suspect into custody. Adding a non-cooperative or combative suspect greatly enhances 
that danger. Adding to that volatility was the fact that the arrest was a high-risk felony car stop with ﬁrearms drawn and 
a statistically greater likelihood of the suspect possessing weapons, creates one of the most unpredictable and volatile 
situations police oﬃcers are asked to resolve. 
My ﬁrst priority was the safety and security of the community. I gave verbal instructions for the residents to retreat to their 
homes and away from the scene and line of ﬁre. 
My secondary priorities were the safety of the suspect and my fellow oﬃcers. I heard Ofc. Hall request permission to use 
his less-than-lethal shotgun and trusted his judgement to utilize the de-escalatory tool in a manner consistent with policy 
and law. I advised that I was arriving to the scene and I had the department-issued shield to assist with a safe apprehension 
of the suspect(s).

Morgan Hill Police Dept. - CA
Incident Report 2311170048-1 (Report 1 of 2)
I then used my in-car public alert system (loud speaker) to give the driver clear commands and instructions. 
I identiﬁed all oﬃcers on scene as Morgan Hill Police Oﬃcers, I then warned the occupant(s) that failure to follow the 
commands of the oﬃcers could result in a use of force including deadly force pursuant to 835a PC.
I continued to offer de-escalation by:
1. Offering clear commands to put his hands out of the window.
2. Keep both  hands outside the vehicle where we can see them.
3. Explaining that we do not want to hurt the occupants but want to give them a safe way to be taken into custody.
4. Explaining what could be a consequence of not following commands (TASER, less-lethal, deadly force)
5. I spoke in a clear and calm voice using family friendly language and ﬁnishing each command with a ""please"".
I could see that the driver had placed one hand outside the vehicle but his other hand was not visible. I explained he was 
not helping himself by failing to follow the instructions and I saw him comply and show both hands outside the window. 
The driver ultimately exited the vehicle as instructed and kept his hands visible allowing the oﬃcers to approach with the 
shield and take him into custody without further incident. 
I approached the scene and saw some blood on the driver's face and asked Ofc. Hall what was on his cheek. Ofc. Hall told 
me it was from the less-than-lethal shot gun. I ensured EMS were available to provide treatment.
I provided oﬃcers with assignments and met with some of the nearby witnesses to get their statements. I also made my 
Departmental notiﬁcations and turned my camera to silent while having those conﬁdential conversations. 
STATEMENT OF (WI) JOEL 
He lived at 
 White Moon Dr and was outside when he saw the BART vehicle driven by the suspect police had in 
custody (in-ﬁeld identiﬁcation made as suspect was standing outside the ambulance during this statement) come through 
his neighborhood in a reckless manner. 
He saw him get out of the car and yell ""Shoot me, just kill me, I don't give a fuck"". He saw the police TASE the suspect as 
he went nuts. He saw the police cars come in with lights and sirens and the police tried to be calm and de-escalate. The 
suspect refused to de-escalate and kept yelling to be killed. He feared for his kids safety thinking the suspect was going to 
hit a pole or his house and ""fucking kill [us]"". He knew the suspect didn't want to go peacefully. 
He ﬁrst saw the suspect get out of the car and confront the police, he came at the police like ""what are you gonna do"". He 
felt that the suspect asked for everything he got. 
END OF STATEMENT
 
I then contacted the homeowner of 
 White Moon Dr. who was identiﬁed as (WI) SUDHIR 
 During his 
statement I learned he didn't see anything of value but was more interested in discovering what was happening in the 
neighborhood. He only heard a lot of sirens. 
I ensured the oﬃcers assigned to their various tasks understood what was needed and I returned to MHPD.
NOTE: There was a citizen ﬂag down on scene who advised 3rd party that her friend saw the suspect throw items from the 
vehicle. I had Ofc. Granado and Ofc. Hall check the area but they did not ﬁnd anything of evidentiary value. I also checked 
the area and did not ﬁnd anything. On review of dash camera later I saw nothing of value thrown from the vehicle.

 To document my activity in this case.
 
ACTIVITY:
 On 11/17/2023 at approximately 1559 hours, I was working in my Morgan Hill Police Department (MHPD) uniform and 
driving a fully marked MHPD vehicle (#157) as a patrol oﬃcer assigned to Team D. At this time, Oﬃcers received an 
Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) notiﬁcation on a reported stolen white FORD Transit van (CA Lic #1498662) in 
the area of eastbound Cochrane Road and US 101 Freeway to circulate for the vehicle. 
I drove northbound on the US 101 Freeway to Bailey Avenue and did not locate the vehicle. I drove southbound on the US 
101 Freeway to return back to the city. While I was in heavy traﬃc on the US 101 Southbound freeway, Oﬃcer Hall (L272) 
advised he had located the vehicle in the area of Butterﬁeld Boulevard and Cochrane Road. Shortly after, Oﬃcer Hall advised 
he was conducting a high risk stop on the vehicle. I responded Code-3 (emergency lights and siren) from approximately 
1 mile north of the Cochrane Road exit. Oﬃcer Hall advised the driver closed the door, and knowing the high-risk involved 
with an uncooperative felony suspect in a felony vehicle stop, I continued driving to his location. Oﬃcer Rocha advised he 
was with Oﬃcer Hall and Oﬃcer Broyer advised he was on scene shortly after.
As I approached Cochrane Road and Skipper Lane, Oﬃcer Hall advised the vehicle was taking off from them. I saw Oﬃcer 
Broyer, Oﬃcer Hall, and Oﬃcer Rocha in pursuit of the vehicle and began following the pursuing units. 
After a short pursuit of the vehicle including a successful stop-stick deployment by Corporal Silva, JOSEPH CARDOSO ﬁnally 
yielded in the dead-end of Golden Eagle Court. JOSEPH immediately exited the vehicle and I heard Oﬃcer Hall telling him 
to show him his hands. JOSEPH had his hands next to his waistband and was yelling obscure vulgarities while disobeying 
Oﬃcers' commands. JOSEPH appeared to be reaching his right hand back inside the vehicle and kept ﬂailing his arms 
around in a frantic manner. JOSEPH sat back inside the driver's seat of the vehicle brieﬂy before quickly exiting again. He 
raised his left hand and gestured with it while reaching his right hand toward the drivers' door/driver's seat area. Oﬃcer Hall 
announced ""less lethal less lethal"" and I heard the deployment of the less-than-lethal shotgun and saw JOSEPH immediately 
hunch forward. JOSEPH got back into the vehicle, and shut the door. Oﬃcer Hall deployed two more rounds from the 
less-than-lethal shotgun and ultimately gained JOSEPH's compliance. Oﬃcers were ultimately able to take JOSEPH into 
custody and Fire and EMS arrived on scene to assess JOSEPH.
 After Oﬃcers cleared the FORD, I saw there were surveillance cameras on the outside of 
 Golden Eagle Court facing 
where the suspect vehicle stopped. I contacted the homeowner, AGNERINA 
 and the following is a summary of here 
statement.
 
STATEMENT OF AGNERINA

Morgan Hill Police Dept. - CA
Incident Report 2311170048-1 (Report 1 of 2)
AGNERINA conﬁrmed she had working surveillance cameras which would have recorded the incident, however, she said 
she was not able to review or download the footage. She said she heard sirens and walked outside of her house when she 
saw oﬃcers. She ran back into her home because she was ""scared"". AGNERINA allowed me to assist with trying to retrieve 
surveillance footage.
END OF STATEMENT
 
I discovered AGNERINA had a Lorex security system installed with a DVR located in her bedroom closet. I attempted to 
playback the footage, but the feature was password protected. AGNERINA said she did not know what the password was. 
I attempted several commonly used default passwords but was unsuccessful. AGNERINA said she would contact the 
company who installed the system for her and would provide the footage at a later date if it was recoverable. I provided 
AGNERINA with my business card including the case number.
Sergeant Woodrow tasked Oﬃcer Hall and I with searching for discarded items in the area of Cochrane Road and De Paul 
Drive. He said a witness observed JOSEPH throw an unknown item out of the vehicle into the center median of Cochrane 
Road. Oﬃcer Hall and I responded to the area but did not ﬁnd anything of evidentiary value.
At the time of this report, I have not received surveillance footage from AGNERINA.
 
No further action by this oﬃcer.
 
DISPOSITION:
Case forwarded to DA for review.

SYNOPSIS
On 11/17/2023, at approximately 1559 hours, MHPD oﬃcers received an Automated License Plate Reader notiﬁcation of a stolen white 2016 Ford 
Transit Van (CA Exempt: 1498662) traveling westbound on Cochrane Road from US 101. Oﬃcers located the vehicle and initiated a felony vehicle 
stop. The driver was uncooperative and ﬂed from oﬃcers. A pursuit was initiated and the driver eventually yielded at the dead end of a residential 
neighborhood. The driver was extremely uncooperative, made furtive movements, and attempted to re-enter the vehicle. Less lethal munitions were 
deployed and the driver was taken into custody without further incident. A records check revealed the driver, in addition to the on-viewed charges, 
had an outstanding Felony bench warrant ($20,000 bail) out of San Jose PD for 10851(a) CVC and 368(c) PC.

First Submitted: 12/06/2023 13:15
This supplemental is to document that while processing this case, I needed to notify San Jose Police Department that their 
warrant C2310738 was not served. JOSEPH was unable to sign the notice to appear and therefore the warrant can not be 
considered served. I sent the proper notiﬁcation to San Jose Police Department to advise them that the warrant needed to 
be re activated. 
Disposition: DA warrant request

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
Officers were dispatched to a burglary in progress. Officers arrived on scene and contacted the suspect's which 
resulted in an Officer Involved Shooting. (A) Sergio Vargas Garibay, (A) Jose Aguilar, and (A) Brenda Prado were 
taken into custody. Tracy Police Department's General Investigation Unit responded and assumed the investigation.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 (Sunday) at 0335 hours, I (1L22) was dispatched to 6653 Hopkins Road (Best Buy Warehouse) 
regarding a burglary in progress. I arrived on scene at approximately 0345 hours.
The security guard at the business advised Tracy Police Dispatch two males were breaking in on the side of the 
business. The security guard was on site and watching from the camera system at the guard shack. The subjects 
were on the west side of the building. Both subjects were wearing all black with ski masks and driving a gray Infiniti 
SUV. The security guard continued to provide information to dispatcher's and provided the license plate of the Infiniti 
as being 
. The subjects broke into one of the trucks and were on the east side of the building on Hopkins. 
The reporting party lost visual, and Officers arrived on scene.
While enroute to the called location, I heard Officer Bourassa via radio advise he along with Officer Ortega and 
Officer Macias were checking the parking lot. Shortly after, I heard ""Shots Fired"" and two suspects were running 
towards the north side of the parking lot. There were two suspects detained at the scene.
I arrived at the location and went to the north side of the scene on Promontory Parkway. I asked on the radio if all 
Officers were okay at the scene of the Officer Involved Shooting. I had no other update and attempted drive to the 
scene but could not get to them from the east. I went back to the north end and determined we did not have a 
perimeter. I began setting up a perimeter and then drove the scene of the Officer Involved Shooting. Once at the 
scene, I was informed a female later identified as (A) Brenda Prado was in the back seat of a patrol vehicle. Officers 
on scene were tending to (A) Sergio Vargas Garibay who was struck by gunshots. Shortly after, American Medical 
Response arrived on scene and paramedics tended to Sergio. Sergio was later transported to San Joaquin County 
General Hospital for medical care and Officers at the scene were not injured.

Corporal Smith arrived on scene and informed me to have Officer Figueroa and I respond to a prowler/burglary on 
the east side of town. Officer Fugueroa handled the call for service as I was still enroute. I turned around and went 
back to the scene of the Officer Involved Shooting. I was informed several tractor trailers needed to be cleared. 
Officer Orvick arrived on scene, and I informed her we needed to clear the tractor trailers. Officer Orvick grabbed her 
partner K-9 Zak and began checking tractor trailers. I noticed several tractor trailers were open and there was 
property on the ground near a trailer. We checked the area but did not locate anyone.
Officer Orvick and I drove to 6389 Hopkins Road and worked our way from the south end to Promontory Parkway, 
which resulted in negative results for the two outstanding suspects. Officer Orvick and I went to Officer Figueroa's 
location due to him locating clothing on Promontory Parkway, west of Hansen Road. Zak was unable to do a track on 
the clothing. Officer Orvick and I began clearing the northwest parking lot of Best Buy, when Officer Jamora located 
someone hiding a dirt field north of Promontory Parkway between Hansen Road and International Parkway on his 
drone.
I drove to the location and noticed a suspect laying on the ground who was later identified as (A) Jose Aguilar. I gave 
Jose commands and he complied. I placed Jose in handcuffs and conducted a pat search of Jose. I had Jose sit in 
the back seat of my patrol vehicle. An area check was conducted for any weapons. I drove Jose to the Tracy Police 
Department and placed him in a holding cell after thoroughly searching him. Officer Goodspeed transported Brenda 
to the Tracy Police Department and stayed with her and Jose.
It should be noted the following fire personnel from South County Fire responded to the scene;
-Captain Carlos Hampton
-Engineer Justin Legasa
-Firefighter Broc Bandoni
The following paramedics responded to the scene from American Medical Response;
-Paramedic Tiffany Wallis
- EMT Gary Smith
Lt. Hernandez informed me I could secure and write my report when I come back in at 1400 hours. I secured for the 
day and logged off duty.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This is a supplemental report documenting my actions regarding an in-progress commercial burglary.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023, at about 0334 hours, I was assigned to the Tracy Police Department Bureau of Field Operations. 
TPD units were dispatched to 6653 Hopkins Rd for a report of an in-progress commercial burglary of the Best Buy 
warehouse. The onsite security guard called to report that unknown subjects had gained entry and were using bold 
cutters to break into trailers. The onsite security guard stated the subjects were wearing dark clothing, ski mask, and 
driving a light color, Infinity SUV.
Officer Bourassa, Officer Ortega, and Officer Macias arrived on scene prior to my arrival. While in route I heard 
Officer Bourassa advised that two were running and shortly after I heard over the radio “shot fired.” Officer Bourassa 
advised that an additional two were running northbound towards the field. I took perimeter on Promontory Pkwy and 
Hopkins Rd but was rerouted to another priority one call which I cleared.
While returning to the call location, I was driving east bound on Promontory Pkwy. Near the intersection of 
Huntington Way and Promontory Pkwy I located a black sweater on the ground, at the time I was unsure if the 
clothing was related. An unrelated citizen called in to advised that he observed a male in the field north of the call 
location. I took another perimeter spot and was advised by Cpl Smith to return to the location of the sweater as it 
could be related.
At about 0531 hours, Officer Jamora advised he located a subject laying in the field. I could see Officer Jamora's 
drone and I assisted Officer Taylor and Officer B Singh with taking the subject into custody. I returned to the location 
of the sweater.
I stayed with the sweater so that it could be collected for evidence. I was relieved by Officer Alexander, who stayed 
with the sweater until evidence technicians arrived on scene.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This supplemental report is to document my involvement in the incident. Original report by several other Tracy PD 
officers.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 0335 hours, I responded to the Best Buy warehouse (6653 Hopkins Rd to a call of a 
burglary in progress. The RP (on site security guard) was reporting two (2) male subjects breaking in on the side of 
the building.
Officer Bourassa, Macias, and Ortega had advised via radio they had arrived on scene. Officer Bourassa requested 
someone try to locate the vehicle which I acknowledged. A brief time later I could hear via the radio ""shot fired"" from 
Officer Bourassa so I proceeded to his location. Officer Bourassa then advised via radio that two male subjects were 
fleeing northbound through a field.
I then immediately rerouted and continued northbound towards the field to where the unknown suspects had fled. I 
conducted an area check with negative results. I took a perimeter spot where the unknown males suspects might 
have been and still had negative results in locating the outstanding suspects.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY
This supplemental report is to document the search warrant authored for the 2021 gray Infiniti QX8 SUV.
NARRATIVE
On 11-19-23 I was assigned to the General Investigations Unit for Tracy Police Dept. Around 0420 hours GIU Sgt. 
notified me of an Officer Involved Shooting and to report to the Tracy Police Dept. The crime scene was located at 
6653 Hopkins Rd. in Tracy (Best Buy warehouse).
I was assigned to team ""B"" for the portion of the investigation. Team ""B"" consisted of Tracy PD Det. Glover, San 
Joaquin County District Attorney Office Investigator (DAI) Chris Friedmann and myself.
I was tasked to author a search warrant for a gray 2021 Infiniti QX8 SUV, 
, which was 
used by the suspects during the commission of the burglary as well as the weapon of the assault with a deadly 
weapon of a police officer. the search warrant was granted by Honorable Judge Lauren Thomasson on 11-19-23 at 
0910 hours.
Around 1035 hours I assisted with the walk through of the crime scene. DAI Friedmann, Det. Glover and I were 
tasked by Sgt. Silva to canvass for any evidence just north of the Infiniti SUV. Other Detectives and DA investigators 
also canvassed the premise of 6653 Hopkins Rd., much further north. 
During the canvass I noted the the northwest gate was open and the padlock to the gate was on the ground and had 
been cut. 
Around 1345 hours DAI Friedmann and I transported (S) Brenda Prado from the Tracy PD jail facility to the Tracy PD 
Detective Annex where Prado was interviewed by Det. Steele.
After Prado's interview, DAI Friedmann and I directed CST Santillan to collect a DNA swab sample (Buccal swap) 
from Prado. CST Santillan was also directed to photograph the clothing Prado was wearing. There appeared to be 
dried blood on the lower portion of the left sleeve of the black and white flannel shirt Prado was wearing. There also 
appeared to be dried blood on the left cargo pocket of the black pants Prado was wearing. There was what appeared 
to be dried blood on the outer portion of lower left pant leg as well as the rear thigh portion of the left pant leg.
CST Santillan was directed to collect Prado's clothing for evidence. Refer to CST Santillan's supplemental report for 
further details.
On 11-20-23 around 1115 hours Det. Glover, DAI Friedmann and I met with CST Martin, CST Valles, CST Desousa 
and CST Santillan at the Tracy Police Dept. Evidence Annex. CST Martin placed trajectory rods through the bullets 
holes in the Infiniti SUV and took digital photos.
Upon inspecting the interior of the Infiniti, I observed there was what appeared to be dried blood on the left portion of 
the back rest to the right rear 2 second row passenger seat. Just to the right of the dried blood was what appeared to 
be a bullet hole. The bullet hole appeared to have entered the from the rear of the seat and exited through the front 
of the seat.

SUMMARY:
This supplemental report documents evidence collected in relation to this officer involved shooting investigation. 
Refer to original report for further details.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/23, while serving as the on-call Crime Scene Technician, I received a call from the Crime Scene Unit (CSI) 
supervisor M. Tankersley at approximately 0432 hours. I was requested to respond to work to assist with an officer 
involved shooting investigation. I arrived at Tracy Police Department (TPD) at approximately 0523 hours and was 
requested to take overall photographs of Officer Bourassa (who was one of the officers involved in the shooting).
I met with Officer Bourassa at the Corporal office and, using my department issued Nikon camera, took overall 
photographs of Officer Bourassa with and without his outer carrier vest. Refer to PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 
 for details. It should be noted photographs were taken with and without a photographic identification 
23-06009-1
card, which includes a full color chart and measuring scale.
After taking photographs of Officer Bourassa, I was advised that the General Investigations Unit (GIU) and CSI unit 
would be having a briefing at approximately 0700 hours to discuss the investigation before heading to the scene. 
After the briefing, myself, CST P. Valles, and CST T. Santillan met with Department of Justice (DOJ) Criminalist's at 
Tracy PD.
Senior DOJ Criminalist Meagan Gallagher and her team took their own photographs of all three officers involved in 
the shooting and conducted a round count of all officer’s service firearms. While they were conducting a round count 
for Officer Bourassa's service firearm, I took photographs of the Glock pistol, pistol magazines and live ammunition. 
Refer to 
 for details. CST Valles and CST Santillan took 
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-2
photographs of the other officers involved. Refer to their reports for further details.
After completing the round count for Officer Bourassa, Criminalist Gallagher provided me with the following items (to 
be immediately booked into evidence so it could be released to DOJ's possession afterwards):

After collecting and intaking the items, myself, CST Valles, CST Santillan, and the DOJ Criminalist team responded 
to 6653 Hopkins Rd, Tracy, CA (Best Buy Warehouse) where the officer involved shooting occurred at. I arrived on 
scene at approximately 1007 hours.

The location of the scene was the east side of the Best Buy Warehouse. Tracy PD command staff had set up a 
command post at the southeast corner of the warehouse with crime scene tape set up around the scene of the 
shooting. Multiple trailers were parked in the east side of the building that were observed to be broken in to.
When Tracy PD detectives and San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office investigators arrived at the warehouse, 
a walkthrough was conducted to view the scene. I observed multiple spent casings on the ground, as well as a Gray 
Infiniti SUV with multiple suspected bullet holes in it and body damage up on a dirt area of the parking lot with broken 
trees behind it. I also observed electronic merchandise on the floor in between parked trailers to the south of where 
the vehicle was located.
After the walkthrough was completed, I was assigned to process the scene of the shooting. Using my department 
issued Nikon camera, I took overall photographs of the scene. Refer to PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 23-
 for details. It should be noted the DOJ Criminalist team were on scene as well.

After placing the evidence markers, I photographed the scene again. Refer to photographs for details. It should be 
noted the scene was windy, and for that reason some placards and items were moving throughout my time at the 
scene.
As photographs were being taken, the DOJ criminalist team was also scanning the scene with a FARO scanner to 
document the scene. Criminalist Gallagher and I were taking photographs of the scene (with placards) in between 
FARO scans.
After photographs were taken with the placards, the DOJ Criminalist team began marking the bullet holes on the 
Infiniti SUV with stickers. I followed behind them as they worked on the vehicle and took photographs of the stickers 
they placed. Refer to DOJ's report for details.
It should be noted that during the time I was photographing the stickers on the vehicle, I took photographs of two cell 
phones that were located in the front passenger side and center console of the vehicle due to Det. Calvache wanting

plate 
). It should be noted I detached item 118 from 117 to make sure the saw would not accidentally go 
off.
After all items were collected and secured in the CSI unit van, I took overall photographs of the scene and of the 
Infiniti SUV being loaded onto the flatbed tow truck. It should be noted that during the loading of the SUV onto the 
tow truck, the driver’s side front bumper got caught on the downed tree and was damaged. Refer to photographs for 
details.
GIU Sgt. Silva advised no further assistance was requested on scene and advise I could clear. I cleared from the 
scene at approximately 1657 hours and returned to Tracy PD. At Tracy PD, I secured all items collected in locked 
evidence lockers to await intake and processing.
At approximately 1739 hours, myself, and CST. Valles were requested at the Tracy PD North Annex facility (1325 N 
MacArthur Dr, Tracy, CA) to assist with the vehicle search of the Infiniti SUV. We arrived at approximately 1742 
hours. CST Valles processed the Infiniti SUV, while I helped him during the search. Refer to his report for details.
We cleared from the North Annex at approximately 2055 hours and returned to Tracy PD.

On 11/20/23, using my department issued Nikon camera, I began taking photographs of all items collected from the 
scene. Reference 
 for details. It should be noted photographs were 
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-45
taken on 11/20/23 and on 11/21/23 due to the large number of items I had collected from the scene.
On 11/20/23, at approximately 1359 hours, I was requested by Det. Steele to go to San Joaquin General Hospital 
(500 W Hospital Rd, French Camp, CA) to photograph suspect Sergio Garibay, collect his buccal swab (per a signed 
warrant), and collect all personal items that the hospital had.
I arrived at the hospital at approximately 1435 hours and went to the Intensive Care Unit and met with hospital staff, 
who took me to the room where Garibay was located in. Garibay was responsive but under medication when I 
advised him what I was there for.
Using my department issued Nikon camera, I took overall photographs of Garibay and the two bags the hospital had 
of his belongings. Reference 
 for details.
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-46
After I took the photographs, I advised Garibay that I would be collecting a buccal swab from him per a signed 
warrant Tracy PD detectives had. Garibay opened his mouth and allowed me to swab (using sterile cotton swabs) 
the inside of his cheeks for a few seconds. The swabs were later booked as EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-119- DNA 
.
BUCCAL SWAB-SERGIO GARIBAY 11/1/84
I took possession of the two bags of Garibay's belongings and cleared from the hospital at approximately 1455 
hours. I went to the Tracy PD North Annex to process and dry (due to wet blood still being present) the items 
collected.
At the North Annex, I used my department issued Nikon camera to take photographs of the items collected from the 
hospital. Refer to 
 for details. It should be noted photographs were 
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-47
taken with and without a photographic identification card, which includes a full color chart and measuring scale.
At the time of inventorying and taking photographs of the items, multiple items were still wet from suspected blood, 
so they were placed in a secure drying room to dry. At the time of this report, the items were still wet and drying. 
Those items will be booked once dry at a later date.
The following items were collected as evidence from the hospital bags:
EVIDENCE ITEM 23-06009-120- BLACK XL SFSU SWEATER WITH SUSPECTED BLOOD ON IT (CUT)

Case # 23-06009 - Supplement - 8 Report
NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:
The purpose of this supplemental report is to document my actions while assisting officers with this investigation. I 
responded as the on-duty watch commander. I received a phone call from Corporal Smith who was the shift 
supervisor, and he gave me a brief summary and advised that officers were involved in an officer involved shooting. 
When I responded to the scene, I advised (I) Officer Manjit Singh to accompany (V) Officer Adrain Macias to the 
police department and (I) Officer Manuel Fong to accompany (V) Officer Joseph Bourassa to the police department. 
Prior to Officer Macias leaving the crime scene I secured his department issued M4 Carbine that he had slung over 
his body. The rifle was secured in my department vehicles locked security box.
SUMMARY:
On 11-19-23, at 0413 hours, I received a phone call from Corporal Smith who was the on-duty supervisor on patrol. I 
was the on-duty watch commander and was at home. Corporal Smith told me one of the officers on-duty had been 
involved in an officer involved shooting while the officer(s) were investigating a in-progress burglary. While on the 
phone Corporal Smith told me the scene was still active and there were 2 outstanding suspects. I told him I would 
respond from home, and I notified Lieutenant Tim Bauer from the Bureau of Investigations on his phone.
I responded in my department issued vehicle and responded straight to the scene. When I arrived, I notified dispatch 
via my police radio that I was on scene.
I met with Corporal Smith on scene and I learned that 3 officers were involved in the shooting. He told me officers 
Ortega, Macias, and Bourassa were involved and had already provided him a public safety statement. At this point 
we had called in the next shift of officers to assist and assigned Officer Manjit Singh to accompany Officer Adrian 
Macias and Officer Manuel Fong to accompany Officer Joseph Bourassa to the police department. The officers were 
instructed to not speak to each other regarding the investigation and to wait for investigators at the police 
department.
Prior to Officer Macias leaving with Officer Singh, I saw he had his department issued M4 Carbine rifle slung over his 
body. I told him I would secure the rifle for the investigation.
I put on latex gloves and made the rifle safe. I removed the magazine and the round that was in the chamber. This 
was recorded by Officer Macias' body worn camera. The rifle was placed in my department issued vehicle and 
remained in my possession until it was collected by evidence technicians for further processing.
While waiting for investigators to respond to the scene I assisted Corporal Smith with keeping the crime scene 
secure. We utilized officers for scene security and crime scene logs. While waiting, Corporal Smith and I walked the 
area of the crime scene where the suspect vehicle came to a stop, and I relayed to Lt. Bauer a general overview of 
the scene.
Later in the morning, CST Tania Santillan responded to the scene. I met with her near the crime scene but on the 
south end of the large warehouse.
At 1008 hours, CST Santillan and I photographed the rifle. I assisted in securing the chamber with a safety tag. She 
photographed the rifle, magazine, and the round I removed from the chamber.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This supplemental report documents digital photos and items collected in relation to this officer involved shooting 
investigation.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 0441 hours, CST Supervisor M. Tankersley contacted me and requested my 
assistance with an officer involved shooting investigation. I responded from my residence and arrived at the Tracy 
Police Department at approximately 0529 hours.
When I arrived, Sgt. Silva instructed me to only take overall photos of Officer A. Macias. I took overall photos of 
Officer Macias using my department issued Nikon camera (photos TS 1-57). I also photographed suspected blood on 
Officer Macias’ uniform pants with and without a measurement scale. Detectives advised a briefing would be held at 
0700 hours including the District Attorney’s Investigators (DAI) prior to doing anything further and responding to the 
scene.
After briefing, I met with Corporal K. Steele and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Criminalists to further photograph 
Officer Macias’ duty weapon (a Glock 17 
) and magazines in the presence of Officer Macias’ lawyer 
(photos TS 58-100). Meagan Gallagher, DOJ Senior Criminalist, conducted a round count of Macias’ Glock 17 and 
each of Officer Macias’ magazines (located on his uniform). Corporal Steele advised the Glock and magazines did 
not need to be collected as the Glock was not the weapon discharged by Officer Macias.
Sgt. Silva advised DOJ Criminalists would take possession of the rifles discharged by officers during the incident 
which were still located at the scene. I left Tracy PD and responded out to the scene at approximately 1003 hours 
which was located at 6653 Hopkins Rd (Best Buy Warehouse), . When I arrived, the scene was secured with yellow 
crime scene tape and patrol vehicles. I checked in with Officer A. Taylor who was maintaining the crime scene log.
Lieutenant R. Hernandez had the rifle discharged by Officer Macias secured in his assigned unmarked vehicle. 
Lieutenant Hernandez rendered the black Colt Defense M4 Carbine Rifle SN: 
 safe

 DOJ 
(Item 23-06009-16).
Criminalist M. Gallagher counted the ammunition rounds in the magazine attached to the rifle which totaled 22 
rounds 
. I photographed the rifle, magazine and ammunition (photos TS 101-133). I released the 
(Item 23-06009-15)
M4 Carbine rifle, magazine, and ammunition to M. Gallagher on scene.
Lieutenant Hernandez advised Officer Macias had additional magazines located in his assigned patrol vehicle #5416. 
I took overall photos of patrol vehicle #5416. Two magazines were found in a rifle bag located on the passenger side 
floorboard of the vehicle. The first magazine contained 29 rounds of ammunition 
 and the second 
(Item 23-06009-17)
magazine contained 27 rounds of ammunition 
 Refer to photos TS 134-170. M. Gallagher also

took possession of these magazines on scene.
Corporal E. Smith advised the rifle discharged by Officer Ortega was located in patrol vehicle #5420. The Colt 
Defense M4 Carbine rifle SN: 
 
did not have a magazine attached. I took overall photos 
(Item 23-06009-19) 
of the rifle (photos TS 171-191). M. Gallagher also took possession of the rifle on scene.

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:
The purpose of this supplemental report was to document the presentation of a photo lineup that was prepared by 
Detective Ken Steele and presented by me on 11/19/23.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/23 I was working as a Tracy Police Officer Unit F7, and I was dressed in full Tracy Police Department 
uniform and wearing AXON body cameras. At approximately 1710 hours, I was contacted by Detective Lissette Ortiz 
who requested that I present a photo lineup to Jose Aguilar regarding case number 23-06009.
I contacted Jose at approximately 1725 hours, at the Tracy Police Department North Annex located at 333 Civic 
Center Dr, Tracy. in order to conduct a photo lineup. It should be noted that Detective Ken Steele prepared the photo 
lineup, and he did not tell me who the allege suspect was in the photo lineup. I contacted Jose and I read Jose the 
Simmons advisement. Jose understood the advisement and he identified photo number 1 as his friend. (It should be 
noted the photo lineup was presented in the following order: 6,2,1,3,5,4)
I asked Jose how sure he was regarding the subject he identified, and Jose advised he was 100 percent sure. Jose 
advised he recognized the subject in the picture because he has the same eyes, hair, and face as his friend who he's 
known for a while. (It should be noted Sergio Vargas Garibay was the subject in photo number 1)
I advised Detective Lissette Ortiz of the above information.
On 11/24/23 I booked the hard copy of the photo lineup at the Tracy Police Department property division as 
evidence.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:
Hard copy of the photo lineup.
CASE STATUS:
Supplemental only, attach to the original report.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY: 
This is to document my involvement in the search for outstanding suspects from a commercial burglary and being 
near the crime scene.
NARRATIVE:
On 11-10-23 at 0359 hours, I was called by TPD Dispatch to respond with K9 Zak to assist with a search of two 
outstanding suspects that fled on foot from a commercial burglary. I responded to the area of Best Buy, located at 
6653 Hopkins Rd.
I first assisted Officer B. Singh in clearing the opened semi-trailers with use of K9 Zak. Due to several Officers in the 
area, I placed K9 Zak on a 25’ long line. I gave a K9 announcement at 0437hours, prior to beginning our search. We 
searched the area, finding numerous trailers where their locks were cut, but no one was located.
Ofc. B. Singh and I then checked the field just east and northeast of the location on foot.
Officer R. Figueroa located what appeared to a be a long-sleeved shirt on the roadway on the westbound lanes of 
Promontory Pkwy believing it to have been discarded by one of the outstanding suspects. I attempted to have K9 
Zak see if he could pick up scent to possibly attempt a track, but K9 Zak did not appear to do so.
Ofc. B. Singh and I went to clear the semi-trailers to the north of the location, finding an open gate and a cut lock on 
the ground. As we were beginning to clear the area when drone operator Officer J. Jamora advised he located 
someone in the open field just north of the location, north of Promontory Pkwy.
Ofc. B. Singh and I responded to the location and located a male subject, later identified as (S) Jose Aguilar, laying 
in the field. We initiated a high risk stop, along with Officers Taylor and Figueroa. I had K9 Zak out of the vehicle, 
holding him by his harness. I made a K9 announcement at 0530 hours and Ofc. B. Singh proceeded to give 
commands to Aguilar. Aguilar was taken into custody without incident. I walked back to my patrol vehicle and 
secured K9 Zak.
I responded back to the north side of the business and proceeded to finishing clearing the semi-trailers with Ofc. 
Taylor. No one was located in the area.
I remained on scene where the open gate and lock was found on the ground until I was relieved by Officer Trine.

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 0358 hours, I responded to assist on an officer involved shooting that occurred in 
the city of Tracy. Upon arrival, I was tasked with searching for two male suspects that had fled the scene on foot. 
Based on the information provided to me over the radio, the last known direction of the two outstanding suspects was 
northbound from the incident location.
I deployed my department issued drone from the parking lot east of the Best Buy warehouse. After about an hour 
and a half, I was able to locate a subject who was later identified as, (A) Jose Aguilar. He was lying in a field just 
north of the Best Buy warehouse on the north side of Promontory Pkwy. Utilizing the spotlight mounted to the drone, 
I was able to direct officers to Aguilar's exact location where he was taken into custody without incident. The video of 
Aguilar's apprehension was booked into property as evidence.
I later spoke with
 who witnessed a suspicious subject run north across Promontory Pkwy while 
seeing many police officers in the area with the emergency lights activated. 
 provided the following statement in 
summary.
 employed by a trucking company who has a contract with FedEx. At approximately 3:40 - 3:45 am while 
 was connecting a FedEx trailer to his truck at the nearby FedEx facility, he heard what he thought was gunfire. 
FedEx is located at 5655 Hood Way in Tracy, Ca which is only about one mile away from where the incident 
occurred.
As 
 continued about his day, 
 left FedEx in his semi-truck around 4am and headed west on Promontory 
Pkwy. As he was passing Amazon at 6250 Promontory pkwy,
 saw a white or Hispanic male wearing a black 
shirt with black pants. The male crawled out of some bushes along the south side of the roadway and ran north 
across Promontory Pkwy right in front of 
 truck. With the headlights of his truck lighting up the male subject, 
 was able to get a good look at the male's face. 
 described the male to have a thin face with sharp 
features. He had a pointed nose with a pointed looking chin. After 
 saw the male for a split second, the male 
covered his face as if he was trying to hide. With the sounds of gunfire from earlier and the heavy police presence 
that 
noticed, he thought the male may have been a suspect in a crime. That is why 
decided to call the 
police and provide the above statement. 
 had nothing further.
Utilizing the drone, I took overall ariel photos and videos of the entire warehouse and its surrounding. They were 
booked into property as evidence.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This supplemental report documents my collection of evidence regarding this officer involved shooting investigation.
NARRATIVE:
On 11-19-2023 at approximately 0430 hours, I received a call from Crime Scene Unit Supervisor M. Tankersley. I 
was directed to respond to the Tracy Police Department (1000 Civic Center Drive) to assist with an officer involved 
shooting investigation. I arrived at the Tracy Police Department at approximately 0525 hours.
I was advised that the General Investigations Unit and CSI Unit would be having a briefing at approximately 0700 
hours, to discuss the investigation and tasks before heading to the scene. Once the briefing concluded, I was tasked 
to photograph Officer Ortega and his equipment.
I met with Officer Ortega in the Emergency Operations Center, located within the Tracy Police Department, at 
approximately 0800 hours, and advised him that I would photographing him and his equipment. Using my 
department assigned Nikon camera, I photographed overall views of Officer Ortega in uniform, with and without his 
outer carrier vest. Photographs were taken with and without a photographic identification card, which includes a full 
color chart and measuring scale All 42 digital photographs of Officer Arturo Ortega were booked as evidence item 23-

Gallagher and her team took their own photographs of Officer Ortega, his service pistol, and conducted a round 
count. While Criminalist Gallagher conducted the round count for Ortega's service pistol, I photographed the Glock 
pistol, ammunition magazine, and ammunition cartridges. All 6 photographs of Officer Ortega's service pistol and-

at approximately 1007 hours. At the arrival of Tracy Police Detectives and San Joaquin County District Attorney's 
Investigators, I was tasked to collect video surveillance from Best Buy Warehouse' security guards.
I met with Best Buy Warehouse 
, who had access to security video. I requested 
 to download video recorded on 11-19-2023, between 0300 to 0600 hours, of all exterior cameras of the Best 
Buy Warehouse. I provided

Zuniga and Calvache. Detectives requested that I collect swab samples from the driver and passenger areas of the 
vehicle and to process the vehicle for prints before a vehicle search was conducted. CST Desousa assisted me with

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
The following is supplemental report to document my involvement in a 459 PC and 245(c) PC case that occurred at 
6653 Hopkins Road (Best Buy Distribution Center). The case is being investigated by Detective Ortiz.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/20/2023, I was assigned as a Detective to the General Investigations Unit at the Tracy Police Department.
A search warrant had been previously granted by San Joaquin County Superior Court Judge Thomasson. I received 
the cell phones previously collected from TPD Evidence. I assisted Detective Ortiz with her request to extract the 
data from the following cell phones pursuant to search warrant.
23-06009-13
Motorola cell phone, Blue in color
IMEI # N/A
Serial #: N/A
Phone # N/A
Owner: N/A
Note: I was not able to obtain a forensic extraction from the Motorola cell phone.
23-06009-14
Samsung cell phone, Black in color
IMEI #
Serial #: N/A
Phone # N/A
Owner: N/A
The forensic extraction was acquired from the cell phone at the department, using specialized forensic tools. The 
data extracted from the cell phone was later provided to Detective Ortiz so she could separate any evidence related 
to her case.
The full extraction for the cell phone was booked into the Forensic Server at the Tracy Police Department.
CASE STATUS:
Attach to original report and forward a copy to Detective Ortiz.

Case # 23-06009 - Supplement - 17 Report
NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This supplemental report documents photographs taken for Tracy Police case #23-06009.
NARRATIVE:
On November 20, 2023, Supervisor Melinda Tankersley asked me to respond to the Tracy Police Department North 
Annex (1325 N. Mac Arthur Drive) to photograph a vehicle that had been involved in an officer involved shooting 
investigation. The vehicle had suspected bullet holes in it, and she asked me to photograph it with trajectory rods in 
the suspected bullet holes.
At approximately 1109 hours, I met with Detective Phil Giusto at the North Annex (1325 N. Mac Arthur Drive.) At the 
North Annex, I observed a grey colored Infinity SUV parked inside. The front driver’s side door panel was off and on 
top of the vehicle. I photographed the exterior and interior of the vehicle. (Photographs – evidence item #23-06009-
44)
I observed lettered stickers on the vehicle at suspected bullet holes/marks. Crime Scene Technician Pedro Valles 
informed me that there had been lettered stickers at each hole/mark, but some had fallen off when the vehicle was 
towed to the North Annex. I placed stickers at the suspected bullet holes that were missing a lettered sticker. My 
stickers were labeled, “DMM##.” I photographed the vehicle with the stickers in place.
I then placed trajectory rods in each suspected bullet hole. I did not have enough of the smaller trajectory rods to 
place in every hole before photographing the vehicle, so I photographed the vehicle in sections. I placed trajectory 
rods in each of the following sections and photographed them:
Driver’s side front fender/quarter panel, hood of the vehicle, and driver’s side of the windshield
Front driver’s side door

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT
On Sunday, 11/19/2023, at approximately 0419 hours, I was the sergeant assigned to the General Investigations 
Unit when I received a telephone call from Lieutenant Bauer requesting detectives and myself to respond to an 
officer-involved shooting that had just occurred during a burglary in progress. I notified detectives to respond to the 
investigations annex to assign tasks.
I arrived at the investigations annex and read the call for service notes to learn about the incident. I then met with Lt. 
Bauer, who told me he notified the District Attorney's Office to activate the officer-involved shooting protocol team of 
investigators (DAI). After DAI arrived at the investigation's annex, we paired DAI's with detectives to investigate the 
incident. The Department of Justice - Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) assisted with collecting evidence.
Tracy PD crime scene technicians and BFS technicians photographed the officers involved in the shooting (Ortega, 
Macias, Bourassa) and allowed them to go off duty after meeting with their attorney.
Detectives and DAI responded to the Best Buy Warehouse where the incident occurred. I arrived and saw crime 
scene tape securing the area where the shooting took place. Detectives and DAI walked the scene before 
conducting interviews. I stayed on-scene to supervise while BFS technicians and Tracy PD CSTs processed the 
crime scene.
When all the evidence was collected, the suspect vehicle (2021 Infinite QX8) was towed to the Tracy PD Evidence 
facility at my request. I followed directly behind the tow truck as it towed the Infinite from the crime scene to the 
evidence facility.
I turned in the CHP 180 Form to records.

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT
SUMMARY:
The purpose of this supplemental report is to document (A) Brenda Prado’s statement. Brenda admitted to being in 
the suspect vehicle (a silver Infiniti SUV) while she and three other subjects illegally entered the gated Best Buy 
Warehouse parking lot looking for items to steal. Brenda confirmed she was sitting in the front passenger seat while 
either Sergio [later identified as (A) Sergio Garribay] or Jose/Chito (yet to be identified) drove the vehicle during the 
officer involved shooting.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 0420 hours, I was contacted by Sergeant Silva via telephone regarding an officer 
involved shooting that occurred in Tracy, California. I arrived at the Tracy Police Department detective annex and at 
approximately 0700 hours, a briefing was completed regarding the shooting.
During the briefing, video surveillance from the Best Buy Warehouse (6653 Hopkins Road in Tracy) was shown. I 
learned Tracy Police Department Officers; Macias, Bourassa, and Ortega all discharged their firearms when a 
vehicle attempted to run over Officer Macias and Bourassa. After the briefing, Detective Ortiz, San Joaquin County 
District Attorney Investigator Sant, and I watched as one by one each officer was processed after the shooting.
All officers were wearing blue Tracy Police Department uniforms with BDU style pants. All three of the officers’ shirts 
had blue and gold Tracy Police patches on each shoulder. Each officer was also wearing exterior police vests (refer 
to photos) with their name and silver badge affixed to the vest. All involved officers also wore earpieces which goes 
inside their ear and attached to their department portable radio. Please note, all involved officers were driving fully 
marked black and white Tracy Police Department patrol vehicles during the time of this incident. Officer Bourassa’s 
exterior vest said police on the front and back. Officer Bourassa also wore a black hat with a silver Tracy Police 
badge attached to the front. Officer Macias and Officer Ortega wore exterior vests with the words police on the back. 
For more information regarding what the officers were wearing the night of the incident, please refer to the 
photographs taken.
The processing of the officers included, photographs and round counts of their department issued firearms. There 
were no statements regarding the incident provided by officers during this time.
Detective Ortiz, San Joaquin County District Attorney Investigator Sant, and I responded to the Best Buy Warehouse 
parking lot where the incident occurred. We conducted a walk through of the scene. The scene was marked off with 
crime scene tape. Inside the scene, I saw a silver four door Infiniti SUV bearing a temporary license plate of 
. Through a CLETS inquiry, this license plate was determined to not belong on this vehicle. The Infiniti’s 
front driver side exterior door shell was peeled away and found near a red fire hydrant.
Multiple expended rifle cartridges along with an empty rifle magazine were found on the driver side of the Infiniti. The 
driver side airbags were also deployed. The bullets holes I was able to see at the scene were through the front of the 
windshield, the driver side door, the driver side rear passenger door, and the rear hatch. Most of the bullet holes 
were concentrated on the driver compartment of the vehicle.

For more information regarding the scene of the incident please review the photos taken of the scene.
After conducting a walkthrough of the scene. Detective Ortiz, San Joaquin County District Attorney Investigator Sant, 
and I contacted security guard Armando Louriero at the scene. Armando advised he saw the incident occur via the 
Best Buy Warehouse security cameras. While watching the incident occur, Armando stated he believed, and officer 
was ran over. For more information regarding Armando’s statement, please refer to Detective Ortiz’s report.
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 1340 hours, San Joaquin County District Attorney Investigator Sant and I contacted 
Brenda Prado in the Tracy Police Department suspect interview room.
The following statement was video recorded and has been summarized below. The purpose of the summary is to 
render an overview of what was described; however, they are not transcriptions of the recorded interviews The 
summary should not be viewed as containing only the important facts of the interview. They are intended to provide 
the reader with a general understanding of what was said; therefore, refer to the recording itself for the exact wording.
While Brenda was in the interview room her left hand was secured to the interview table using a pair of handcuffs. 
Together we collectively engaged in small talk regarding Brenda and where she grew up. Prior to speaking with 
Brenda regarding this incident, I read Brenda her Miranda Rights via my department issued Miranda Advisement 
Card. Brenda told me she understood her rights.
Brenda advised she resides in different motels in Oakland. Brenda told me she consumes alcohol daily and drinks it 
excessively. Initially when I asked Brenda who was with her this evening she paused and stated well I was with 
“Serg.” Please note though out our conversation, Brenda would sometimes refer to Sergio Garibay as Serg. Brenda 
advised she has known Sergio since she was about eight or ten years old. Brenda is currently twenty-seven years 
old.
Brenda said on this evening before the shooting occurred, she was at her hotel room at the Bay Breeze (unknown 
city) with another subject who she did not identify. Brenda met with a subject she knows as only Jose. Brenda stated 
Jose’s nickname is Chema. Brenda described Jose as being short and skinny. Brenda also refers to him as “little 
Jose.” Please note; It was later determined through this investigation this Jose’s name was Jose Aguilar. Jose 
Aguilar was the subject we took into custody the night of the incident.
Once Jose Aguilar picked her up, they went and meet with Sergio at his residence in Oakland. Brenda advised the 
vehicle used in this incident was already at Sergio’s house. The four (Brenda, Sergio, Jose Aguilar, and Jose 
unknown last name) rode in the vehicle while the Jose Aguilar drove them to Tracy. The other Jose (unknown last 
name) with them, Brenda described this Jose (unknown last name) as short and “stubby” with a nickname of Chito. 
Brenda explained everyone was wearing black this evening. She did not provide any specific details about any of the 
subject’s outfits.
Once at the Best Buy Warehouse, Brenda advised she was seated in the front seat of the vehicle and took two shots 
of alcohol. Brenda stated when she goes out with the involved subjects, she never drives but acts as a look out for 
the others. Brenda did not know who got out of the SUV and cut the lock to the secured property gate at the 
warehouse. Brenda advised they entered the Best Buy property to see what they could find. Brenda said there wasn’
t a plan about what they would do once inside the property. While inside the gated property, Brenda stated all four 
subjects at different times, exited the vehicle, and checked different trailers to steal merchandise.
Brenda advised Sergio backed the vehicle in between two trailers. Brenda said all three subjects (Sergio, Jose 
Aguilar, and Jose unknown last name) exited the vehicle. Brenda stated she then heard, “screaming,” stop and don’t 
move. Brenda did not know if it was an employee, security guard or the police. Once she heard the screaming, 
Brenda went into the fetial position and sat on the floorboard of the vehicle. Brenda told me since she was on the 
floor, she did not see the police. However, Brenda remembered hearing people yell (possibly including herself), 
“Dale” (which is Spanish for go) from inside the car and the car took off. Brenda advised when the shooting occurred, 
she could hear the gunshots and felt something get warm on her body. The vehicle then stopped. Brenda stated no

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY
This supplement documents the following:
Two interviews with the original 
The viewing of the Best Buy video
NARRATIVE
On 11/19/23, while working as a detective and assigned to the general investigations unit (GIU) for the Tracy Police 
Department, I received a phone call from Sergeant Silva at 0425 hours. Sergeant Silva told me an officer-involved 
shooting (OIS) occurred in Tracy and I needed to respond.
I arrived at the TPD annex at approximately 0530 hours and learned the incident occurred at 6653 Hopkins Rd. in 
Tracy which is the BestBuy warehouse. I also learned (A) Sergio Garibay (driver), (A) Brenda Prado (front 
passenger), and (A) Jose Aguilar had been arrested, and one suspect was currently outstanding.
STATEMENT #1 WITH
At approximately 0635 hours, I called the original 
 who is the security officer for the Best Buy 
warehouse. The phone call was recorded using my TPD-issued digital recorder. The recording was later booked into 
evidence at TPD. 
told me the following in summary:
 began by telling me he did not know there were more than two suspects. 
 told me at 
approximately 0330 hours, he called the police because he saw a vehicle, he did not recognize approaching the 
guard shack. 
 watched the vehicle drive around the parking lot, so he decided to follow the vehicle on his 
camera system. He watched the vehicle drive to the east side of the business and watched as two unknown subjects 
exited the vehicle. Both of the subjects were wearing ski masks and cut the gate into the lot. 
 continued to 
watch as the suspects began to open trailers.
 said he relayed what he was seeing to TPD dispatch. 
 stated he watched as TPD officers arrived on scene and attempted to contact the suspects. As officers 
approached the suspects, 
 saw the suspect vehicle appear in camera angle and watched it as it tried to flee. 
As the vehicle was driving, there was an officer in front of the vehicle and 
 said he believed the officer might 
have moved out of the way. 
 said it looked like it “got crazy” after that. 
 said he saw guns and then 
smoke. After, he saw the suspects exiting the vehicle and saw two of the suspects running away. He stated he saw 
two other suspects remain near the vehicle and the officers on scene were able to detain him.
I asked 
 if it appeared that the driver of the vehicle was trying to run over the officers on the scene. 
replied, “Pretty much because it looked like the officer was trying to go around him to trap them on both 
sides. The driver hit the gas and one of the officers was kind of in front of him and dodged away.” 
 stated he 
rewatched the video in slow motion and was able to see that the police officers were okay. This ended the 
conversation with 
.
At approximately 0700 hours, TPD detectives along with District Attorneys Investigations (DAI) and the Department 
of Justice/Burau of Forensics (DOJ/BFS) briefed on the incident. As we were briefing, I received a screen recording 
video from Lt. Hernandez who was on scene. Below is a brief summary of the screen recording we watched:

The video showed what appeared to be a parking lot. The first officer appears on camera view and is seen running 
northbound. A portion of the second officer appears on camera view and is also running northbound. The third officer 
appears on camera view, but it is still a short distance away from the first two officers. An SUV vehicle appears on 
camera entering from the east and drives towards two of the officers. All three officers begin to shoot towards the 
vehicle until the vehicle comes to a stop.
After watching a brief video from Best Buy, Det. Steele and I were partnered up with DAI David Sant. At 
approximately 0828 hours, DAI Sant, Det. Steele, and I, along with DOJ/BFS met with Ofc. Bourassa, Ofc. Macias 
and Ofc. Ortega one by one for the processing of the officers. Sergeant Silva advised me all three officers would be 
providing their statements on Tuesday (11/21/23) and would be going home after being processed.
After, DAI Sant, Det. Steele and I drove to the Best Buy warehouse and conducted a walkthrough of the scene. 
While on scene, I met with
. I asked 
 if we could speak once more now that we had 
more information and he agreed.
STATEMENT #2 WITH 
We spoke with 
 inside of the TPD command post at the Best Buy Warehouse parking lot. The interview 
began at approximately 1111 hours. The interview was recorded using my TPD-issued digital recorder and was later 
booked into evidence at TPD. Below is a summary of the second interview with Armando.
walked me through his morning once again and explained he called the police after he saw an unknown 
Infinity SUV vehicle enter the Best Buy parking lot. 
saw two unknown subjects driving around and opening 
several trailer trucks. 
continued watching the suspects and saw that after the suspects opened the empty 
trailers, they both got into the back seat of the vehicle. The vehicle immediately began to drive to a different location 
of the warehouse. 
 said once he saw the vehicle drive away, he knew a third suspect had to be involved 
and was the driver of the vehicle. 
 watched as three TPD officers arrived on the scene and were in the 
same area as the suspects. 
 then saw two suspects run away from the officers as the officers got close. 
Since 
 only saw two suspects running, he believed the third suspect might have already been captured by 
officers.
 said he could not see the suspects’ vehicle because it was in between two trailers. He did however see the 
police officer with their flashlights running. 
said the suspect vehicle then appeared on camera view. By the 
time the suspect vehicle appeared on camera, one of the officers was already in front of the vehicle. 
 said 
he watched the officer’s reaction as the driver “hit the gas” meaning he accelerated towards the officers
 
then stated, “I thought he got hit.” 
 continued to watch and said if the officer did not get hit by the vehicle, 
then he “got clipped” meaning he must have gotten grazed by the vehicle. 
 said afterward, PD did “their 
thing” (meaning they fired their duty weapons) and he believed the driver of the vehicle had gotten shot. 
 
said he then realized there were four people in the vehicle. The last person was a female wearing a plaid shirt.
 said the only person he did not see was the actual driver. After the suspects exited the vehicle, he watched 
as police officers began to attend to the suspect who had been shot. He stated one of the officers had already 
detained the female and the other two suspects had fled. He then saw an ambulance arrive and pick up the suspect 
who had been shot. 
 continued to watch the officers on the scene and saw an officer arrive with a K-9 dog. 
 was able to follow police officers using Best Buy surveillance cameras. Approximately 40 minutes later, he 
watched as officers arrested the third suspect in the field
 stated the video of the arrest for the third suspect 
was not the best since it was further out, but he knew what was happening because of all the police lights and the 
because of reaction of the K9 dog on the scene.
I asked
 if he was able to zoom in and out on the cameras. He stated, “On some of them, not all”. I asked 
if he heard the shots and he replied, “I heard no shots.” He stated he was not sure if he did not hear the 
shots because he was too far away or if it was because he was panicking
 stated when he watched the 
three officers make the approach, he saw one of the officers take a step back and extend one of his arms out. He

then saw the vehicle, and everything else happened so fast. 
 said he then realized the officer who had been 
in front of the vehicle did not get hit because he could see his flashlight. He stated after the vehicle crashed, the first 
person to step out of the vehicle was the female. The second person to exit the vehicle was the person who fell to 
the ground and did not run. The next two suspects who exited the vehicle were the ones who fled on foot. I asked 
 if he saw which door the suspects exited the vehicle, but he was not sure.
I asked 
if he knew how long the suspects were inside of the Best Buy lot before being contacted. 
 
stated he first captured the suspect vehicle at 0330 hours. He said at 0335-0337 hours, the suspects broke the gate. 
At approximately 0345 hours, is when the police officers were already on scene. I asked 
 if he ever saw the 
face of the driver throughout the incident, but he said no.
 described the suspects as the following:
Suspect #1- Driver- 
was unable to provide any details on the driver. However, the driver was 
arrested by TPD on scene and positively identified as (A) Sergio Garibay out of Oakland CA. Sergio was the 
only suspect to be struck by gunfire.
Suspect #2-Front passenger- 
 described suspect #2 as the only female and was wearing a crop top 
shirt. Suspect #2 was arrested by TPD on scene and was positively identified as (A) Brenda Prago out of 
Oakland CA.
Suspect #3- Back seat of the driver- 
 described suspect #3 as a Hispanic male, wearing a black shirt 
with a red logo and black jeans. He was possibly wearing Converse or vans. He believed this because the top 
of the shoes was black, and the bottom sole was white. The third suspect was arrested approximately an hour 
later by TPD officers in the vicinity of the area. The third suspect was positively identified as Jose Aguilar out 
of Oakland CA.
Suspect #4- Back passenger seat-
 described the fourth suspect as a male with blue jeans, a black 
hoodie, a ski mask, and red shoes. Per
, after he ran from police, he took off his ski mask. 
 
believed he was a light-skinned Hispanic male or Caucasian. Suspect #4 is currently outstanding.
At the conclusion of the interview
 asked me if the officers were okay. I told him all three officers were 
uninjured and thanked him for his assistance.

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY
This supplement documents the interview with (A) Jose Aguilar.
NARRATIVE
On 11/19/23, at approximately 1600 hours, I was at the TPD annex and was preparing to interview (A) Jose Aguilar. 
Jose was the third suspect arrested by TPD officers.
INTERVIEW WITH JOSE AGUILAR
At approximately 1602 hours, I entered the interview room with DAI Sant. I introduced myself to (A) Jose Aguilar and 
told him I was the detective assigned to the case. The interview was conducted in Spanish at the request of Jose. 
Below is a summary of the interview. For further details, please refer to the digital recording of the interview.
I began the interview by reading Jose his Miranda rights in Spanish per my Miranda card. I asked Jose if he 
understood the rights I had read him and he replied, “Yes.” I asked Jose to walk me through the previous day (11/18
/23), prior to arriving in Tracy. Jose said he woke up at approximately 1300 hours at the “Welcome Inn” motel in 
Oakland. He dropped off a letter to the wife of one of his friends whom he met at Santa Rita Jail. Afterward, he went 
back to his hotel and was hanging out with a female. I asked if the female was Brenda, but he said no and said he 
would rather not name her. Jose said at approximately 1900 hours, he got a phone call from Brenda telling him she 
wanted to see him since he had just gotten out of Santa Rita jail on Friday (11/17/23). Jose picked her up and they 
went back to his motel room.
Jose said he remained in his room with Brenda until 0200 hours of 11/19/23 when she received a phone call from a 
“friend” asking if he and Brenda wanted to go to Tracy. Jose was told, the plan was to go to Tracy and pick up a car. 
Jose and Brenda agreed, and they headed to Tracy with two other friends. When they exited the freeway, they 
began to drive around the warehouses in the area. They arrived at the first warehouse, (unknown name) opened 
some trailers, and saw they were empty, so they left.
They arrived at the Best Buy warehouse and opened a lot of trailers. He stated they located a trailer with a lot of 
items, so they stopped. After a few minutes, Jose heard what he believed to be security officers arriving and began 
shooting at them. Jose got into the vehicle and went down to the floor. After the shooting, Jose realized they had just 
crashed. He said his friend who was driving yelled out that he had been shot. Jose said his friend who he only 
named as “Chitapan” attempted to put the car into drive, but the car would not move. Chitapan then opened the front 
passenger door, pushed Brenda out, then pushed the driver out of the car.
Jose clarified that Brenda was sitting in the front passenger seat and he was sitting behind the driver. I asked if 
Sergio was driving, and Jose told me he did not know who Sergio was but knew the driver as “Tricky.” (Tricky was 
later confirmed to be Sergio Garibay and will be referred to as Sergio from here on out). Jose said, as Sergio began 
to yell out that he had been struck by gunfire, he also shouted he was stuck and could not move. Chitapan was 
sitting behind Brenda. Jose said once Brenda and Sergio were out of the car, Chitapan exited the vehicle next, and 
Jose was the last one. Jose said as he was exiting the vehicle, he no longer heard gunshots. Once he and Chitapan 
were out of the car, they both fled on foot. I asked Jose where he ran to, he said left the Best Buy property and 
crossed the street.

I asked Jose, once they found the trailers full of items, what were their roles. He stated he and Chitapan exited the 
vehicle. Chitapan had a saw with him and cut open the lock to the trailers. Once the locks were cut, Jose would go 
inside the trailer and would start to unload items. Brenda did not have a role and was just a passenger. Sergio was 
the driver.
Jose told me the Infinity SUV belonged to Chitapan and he was the one who drove them from Oakland to Tracy. 
However, when they arrived at the Best Buy warehouse, Chitapan exited the vehicle and began to search the 
trailers. Jose felt that Chitapan should not search by himself, so he exited the vehicle and helped him out. Sergio 
who was sitting in the back seat also exited the vehicle but moved to the driver’s seat.
I asked Jose, once he heard what he believed to be security officers, and prior to getting into the vehicle, what else 
did he hear? Jose said he heard yelling, “Put your hands up.” Jose was inside a trailer when he heard the yelling. He 
said Chitapan was already running towards the vehicle, so he followed and ran towards the vehicle as well. I asked 
Jose, when he heard the phrase, “Let me see your hands” if he understood what it meant since it was in English and 
he said, “Yes.” I asked Jose, once they were all inside the vehicle, what he heard but he could not remember. I 
asked Jose if he saw the two officers in front of the Infinity, but he said no. I asked Jose if he saw when Sergio 
almost hit the two officers who were in front of the Infinity SUV, but he said no. I told Jose, the incident was captured 
on video surveillance from Best Buy. Jose said he did not see the officers, but he knows the police will not shoot at 
you, “unless they feel like are in danger.” He said once he heard the shooting, he knew something serious must have 
happened, but he did not know what it was. I asked Jose if anyone inside the car told Sergio to stop, but he said no. 
Jose said he heard as the officers yell at them to stop.
I asked Jose to provide me with further details on Chitapan. 
 
 He stated 
Chitapan was wearing a hoodie, face mask, gloves, and possibly black pants. I asked Jose if he had Chitapan’s 
phone number.
I asked Jose how many gunshots he heard. He said he was not sure but said approximately 10-15 rounds. I asked 
Jose why he had not stopped when the police told him to. Jose said simply because he was not driving. After, I 
explained to Jose his charges and asked him if he had any questions, but he said no. This concluded my interview 
with Jose. I stepped out of the interview room at approximately 1644 hours. As I was walking out, I asked Jose if he 
saw a photo of Sergio, would be able to confirm his identification and he said yes.
Det. Steele made a photo lineup which was then shown to Jose by Ofc. Perez-Miranda at approximately 1725 hours. 
Jose was able to pick out Sergio Garibay from the lineup as “Tricky.” Please refer to Ofc. Perez-Miranda’s 
supplement for further detail.
Jose Aguilar was booked into county jail for PC459, PC148 and PC182.

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL
On 11/19/23 I was working for the Tracy Police Department assigned to the general investigations unit. At 
approximately 0500 hours, I responded to a callout regarding an Officer Involved Shooting that had just occurred in 
the early hours of 11/19/23.
I responded to the Tracy PD investigations annex where I was debriefed on the incident.
During an initial walk through of the crime scene, Detective Cockey and I located a Slonik brand headlight lamp on 
the north side of the property approximately 60 ft south of the north gate and approximately 345ft east of the north 
entry gate. We also found what appeared to be a shoe print on a tan colored metal box along the north fence. The 
tan colored metal box was located approximately 100 meters east of the north gate. The box appeared to be an 
electrical box. It appeared as if the box could have been used by someone to climb over the iron fence. The tan 
electrical box had a faded red in color stain which could have possibly been blood. The stain was swabbed for 
processing of possible DNA. At the north gate to the property, we located a cut lock and a lock attached to a metal 
plate. It appeared the metal plate had been attached to the gate at some point to keep it secured. CST Pedro Valles 
assisted in photographing and collecting the above-mentioned items.
Detective Cockey and I were also assigned to collect video surveillance from the Best Buy warehouse located at 
6653 Hopkins Rd. in Tracy, CA. The video surveillance was collected and booked as evidence by CST Pedro Valles. 
The video was later reviewed and documented by Detective Cockey.
At approximately 1800 hours, Detective Calvache and I responded to the Tracy PD North Evidence Annex to conduct 
a search of the suspect’s vehicle that was used in the commission of the crime. The suspect’s vehicle was a gray 
2021 Infinity Qx80 SUV 
. Detective Giusto with the Tracy Police Department authored a 
search warrant for the vehicle, which was reviewed and signed by Judge Lauren Thomasson, Honorable judge of the 
San Joaquin County Superior Court. A copy of the signed warrant was left on the windshield of the vehicle after the 
search was concluded.
During the search, CST Pedro Valles and CST Brian Desousa took photographs of the vehicle. They also processed 
the vehicle for DNA and fingerprints. Refer to CST Valles supplemental report for details. Some of the items that 
were found in the suspect vehicle were the following:
Multiple bags/backpacks were found in the rear passenger seats and in the trunk. The bags contained numerous 
amounts and variety of tools such as pliers, screwdrivers, and power tools. The bags also contained a total of 43 key 
fobs belonging to different vehicle makes and models. I found a pair of large red bolt cutters on the rear driver’s side 
passenger seat, possibly used to cut the gate lock to the Best Buy warehouse. The following are additional items that 
were found in or around the backpacks located inside the vehicle:
- 26.5 GGW OF SUSPECTED METHAMPHETAMINE LOCATED INSIDE ADIDAS BAG
-10.8 GGW OF SUSPECTED METHAMPHETAMINE IN SMALL BLACK CASE
- 2 GLASS PIPES

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
This report documents my review of the phone extraction associated to A/Sergio Garibay.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/20/2023, Detective Daniel provided me with a phone extraction for a cell phone located in the vehicle driven 
by the suspect in this case. The device is a Samsung, Galaxy S21Ultra 5G, with an IMEI number of 
. The various user accounts located on the device were associated to A/Sergio Garibay, including 
 
 
I reviewed this extraction in an effort to identify the fourth outstanding suspect in this case. Based on statements 
made by A/Aguilar, the fourth suspect went by a nickname of ‘Chito’ or ‘Chito Pan’ and may also be named Jose. He 
described ‘Chito’ as being a Hispanic male in his 30’s, from Hayward, and was missing a tooth on the upper left side 
of his mouth. In the extraction I discovered three contacts that I believed could be numbers for the fourth suspect.
Reviewing A/Garibay’s call history, I found that he had made an outgoing call on 11/19/2023 at 02:15:23 hours to 
‘Chitopanga’. The call showed answered with a duration of 8 seconds. I provided the phone number of
 
to Detective Azevedo to obtain a search warrant for subscriber information and historical call detail records for this 
phone number.
No other items of evidentiary value were located in the phone extraction at this time.

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL
On 11/29/23 I interviewed Jeremy Ward (South County Fire Authority Firefighter) regarding his response to the 
incident that occurred on 11/19/23 (case 23-06009). The interview was in person and took place at Station 91 in 
Tracy, CA at approximately 1000 hours.
Jeremy Ward is currently employed by the South County Fire Authority and is currently a Fire Captain. Ward has 
worked with the South County Fire Authority for approximately 18 years. On 11/19/23, Ward was working his regular 
scheduled shift at Station 94 in Tracy, CA.
Ward stated he was dispatched to the report of a shooting in the early hours of 11/19/23. Ward stated there were no 
other details regarding the shooting. Ward stated they responded code 3 (lights and siren) from Station 94. Ward 
said it took them approximately 5 minutes to get to the scene. Once they got to the scene, Ward said they got 
cleared to enter by law enforcement almost immediately after getting there.
At the scene, Ward and his team were directed towards a patient that was sitting down next to a vehicle that was 
behind some bushes. Ward sated AMR was already attending to the patient by the time they got there. Ward 
assisted AMR in transferring the patient on a gurney and ultimately placing the patient in the back of an ambulance 
for him to be transported to the hospital. Ward advised the treatment provided on scene was minimal because the 
patient needed to be taken to the hospital. Ward remembers the patient kept saying he was thirsty.
Once the ambulance left with the injured patient, Ward was directed by police officers to do a medical assessment of 
a female that was detained at the scene. Ward stated the female had no gunshot wounds or any type of traumatic 
injury. Ward stated the female refused any type of medical treatment.
Ward and his team cleared the scene and drove to San Joaquin County Hospital to pick up his crew member who 
had ridden in the ambulance during the patient transport to the hospital.

INTERVIEW WITH OFFICER ADRIAN MACIAS
At approximately 1458 hours, DAI Sants and I met with Ofc. Macias and his attorney Brian Gabriel for a voluntary 
statement. Ofc. Macias told me the following in summary:
On 11/19/23, at approximately 0336 hours, Ofc. Macias was working as a police officer in the City of Tracy. Ofc. 
Macias was wearing a full police uniform with a body-worn camera affixed to his vest. He was dispatched to the Best 
Buy warehouse (6653 Hopkins Rd.) on a report of a burglary in progress along with officers Bourassa and Ortega.
He stated he drove code three, which means the lights and sirens on his police vehicle were activated. Prior to 
arrival, he turned off his lights and sirens. Ofc. Macias entered the Best Buy parking lot and parked his vehicle along 
the south/east corner of the parking lot. He noticed there was an open trailer and a cut lock on the ground. Ofc. 
Macias stepped out of his vehicle and assisted officers Bourassa and Ortega with a search of the parking lot.
Ofc. Macias said he began to hear metallic clinking and movement, north of his location. He signaled to his partners 
of the noises and began to walk towards the area of the noise. As they were walking past several trailers, Ofc. 
Macias looked inside the open trailers to make sure there was no one inside.
Ofc. Macias said they continued walking northbound until they reached the end of the parked trailers. He stated he 
began to shine his flashlight at several trailers and saw two pairs of feet. He stated the feet started running north. 
Ofc. Macias announced himself as “Tracy Police” and yelled out to “Freeze! Stop! Put it down!” Ofc. Macias began to 
run parallel to the truck trailers after the suspects.
Ofc. Macias said at that point, he believed the incident was just a foot pursuit. As he began to turn the corner of the 
trailer, he saw Ofc. Bourassa was ahead of him. He then saw an SUV vehicle appear and was approximately five 
yards away from Ofc. Bourassa. Ofc. Macias heard what he believed to be an engine revving up and tires squeaking

(breaking traction). He stated that based on the proximity of the front of the vehicle to Ofc. Bourassa and the speed 
of the vehicle accelerating, he believed Ofc. Bourassa was about to die.
Ofc. Macias said he believed the vehicle was going “pretty quick” and was going to kill, or seriously injure Ofc. 
Bourassa. Ofc. Macias then discharged his TPD-issued rifle. Ofc. Macias then saw the SUV make a turning 
movement and was now headed towards his direction. The SUV was so close to Ofc. Macias that he had to 
“compress his rifle” into his body to prevent the SUV from striking him.
As the SUV was turning in the direction of Ofc. Macias, he believed, “This is it. I'm going to die or be seriously 
injured.” Once he saw the SUV pass him and he saw both Ofc. Bourassa and Ofc. Ortega, he believed the threat 
was over, so he stopped shooting.
Ofc. Macias said after the shooting, he saw one of the occupants of the vehicle exit through the passenger side. The 
suspect ran northeast towards a chain link fence. He did not see anyone else, so the three officers approached the 
vehicle. The vehicle had crashed and was near an embankment. Ofc. Macias saw two of the suspects on the ground 
on the passenger side of the vehicle. He began to give commands to both suspects, a male and a female on the 
ground and told them to not move. He heard the male say that he was injured. A few seconds later, Ofc. Macias 
realized the suspect on the ground had been struck by gunfire. Ofc. Macias and Ofc. Ortega began to provide 
medical assistance. He stated the female who was also on the ground was put in handcuffs and placed in the back of 
one of the patrol vehicles.
As Ofc. Macias and Ofc. Ortega provided first aid, Ofc. Bourassa was putting out radio traffic to dispatch and to 
oncoming units.
I asked Ofc. Macias, when he and his partners first came into contact with the suspects, could he hear his partners? 
He stated as he yelled out commands, he heard Ofc. Bourassa yell out “Tracy Police Department.”
I asked Ofc. Macias if he believed de-escalation was feasible during the time. He said no, because there was an 
imminent threat and there was no chance to use any other kind of force. He stated the only force feasible was deadly 
force because Ofc. Bourassa would have been hit or killed, or he would have been hit or killed if he did not respond 
the way that he did.
I asked Ofc. Macias, if he had not compressed his rifle into his body when the SUV was headed towards him, did he 
believe he would have been struck and he replied, “Yes.” I asked him if he had to move to prevent him from being hit 
by the SUV and he said, “Yes.”
I asked Ofc. Macias if the vehicle surprised him and he said, “Yes.” He also confirmed even though it was nighttime, 
the parking lot was lit with light posts there were light posts throughout the parking lot, and he was using a flashlight.
Ofc. Macias described the suspect vehicle as a large, Infinity SUV vehicle. He did not know how many occupants 
were in the vehicle but said he knew there were at least two because that was what they were chasing. I asked him if 
he saw anyone inside of the SUV and he said no.
Ofc. Macias was asked why he chose his rifle over his pistol, and he replied, “I am more comfortable with the rifle.” 
He also confirmed there is a flashlight affixed to his rifle. He was then asked, when he fired at the SUV, what was his 
target. Ofc. Macias replied, “The driver.”
Ofc. Macias was asked if he visually followed the SUV until it stopped and he said, “Yes.” He was asked why he 
stopped shooting and he said because it would have been crossfire between him and Ofc. Ortega.
Ofc. Macias was asked if had ever been to the Best Buy warehouse before and he said, “No.” He was asked if he 
recognized any of the suspects or had contact with them in the past and he said, “No.”

I asked Ofc. Macias, after the SUV came to a stop, did he see any lights on the vehicle? He said he did and noticed 
the reverse lights on the SUV had turned on. The lights put him on high alert because he believed the vehicle might 
attempt to flee once again.
At approximately 1536 hours, we concluded the interview with Ofc. Macias. Ofc. Macias was wearing his body-worn 
camera which was activated during the entire incident. Please refer to his body-worn camera for full details.
INTERVIEW WITH OFFICER ARTURO ORTEGA
At approximately 1540 hours, DAI Sant and I began the interview with Ofc. Ortega. Below is a summary of the 
interview. For full details, please refer to the audio recording of the interview.
On 11/19/23, at approximately 0336 hours, Ofc. Ortega was working as a police officer in the City of Tracy. Ofc. 
Ortega was wearing a full police uniform with a body-worn camera affixed to his vest. He was dispatched to the Best 
Buy warehouse (6653 Hopkins Rd.) on a report of a burglary in progress along with officers Bourassa and Macias.
Ofc. Ortega said he responded code three which meant the lights and sirens on his patrol vehicle were activated. 
Prior to arriving at the warehouse, he deactivated his lights and sirens. He stated when he arrived at the warehouse, 
he saw an unoccupied vehicle parked in the front of the warehouse, near the guard shack. He stated he believed the 
vehicle parked out front was the vehicle involved in the burglary. Ofc. Ortega contacted the security officer at the 
guard shack who provided him with the possible location of the suspects. As he was driving, he noticed several 
opened trailers, which made him deploy his rifle. Ofc. Ortega stated he parked his vehicle and began walking and 
checking the trailers to make sure no one was hiding inside. As he was clearing trailers, officers Bourassa and 
Macias who were ahead of him began to yell. He was not sure what they yelled out believed they said, “Show me 
your hands.”
Ofc. Ortega began running northbound towards the direction of his partners who were “rounding the corner of the 
trailer.” As he was trying to catch up, he saw Ofc. Bourassa, Ofc. Macias, headlights, and heard tires screeching 
(breaking traction). At that moment, Ofc. Ortega said he believed the vehicle was going to run over both Ofc. 
Bourassa and Ofc. Macias. Ofc. Ortega stated both of his partners were at approximately arm’s length of the vehicle 
and there was an imminent threat to their safety. He stated, “I believed they were going to die.” Ofc. Ortega said he 
discharged his department-issued rifle at the vehicle because the lives of his partners were in danger. He stated the 
vehicle continued driving northwest and crashed into a fire hydrant. After the vehicle crashed, it continued to drive so 
Ofc. Ortega continued to shoot at the vehicle.
Once Ofc. Ortega realized the vehicle was no longer a threat to officers Bourassa and Macias, he stopped shooting. 
He then saw the brake lights on the vehicle turn on, so he believed the vehicle was going to try and reverse into 
them. Ofc. Ortega saw both of his partners and told them both to back up towards him because he was near a trailer. 
The plan was to use the trailer as cover. Once they were behind the trailer, Ofc. Ortega made sure none of the 
officers were injured.
Ofc. Ortega said he then saw two suspects exit the vehicle and take off on foot. He was unable to provide a 
description on the suspects but stated he saw one of the suspects jump over the fence. Ofc. Ortega said they 
advanced towards the vehicle, and he cleared the driver's side to make sure no one else was inside. He continued to 
walk around the front of the vehicle and saw a male suspect on the ground. The male on the ground (who was 
positively identified as Sergio Garibay) told Ofc. Ortega he had been shot in the left leg. Ofc. Ortega retrieved his 
tourniquet from his vest and began to render first aid on Sergio until medics arrived.
After Ofc. Ortega's statement, I asked him a few clarifying questions. I asked him, prior to the shooting, when both of 
his partners first attempted to contact the suspects, what he believed was happening. He stated he believed it was a 
foot pursuit and that the suspect vehicle was still parked in the front of the warehouse. I asked Ofc. Ortega if the 
suspect vehicle surprised him and he said, “Yes.”

I asked Ofc. Ortega if he felt de-escalation was feasible. He said no, because the proximity of the officers to the 
vehicle, the tires of the vehicle screeching and the fact the vehicle came close to running over both officers, there 
was no time for de-escalation. Ofc. Ortega said he believed the vehicle surprised all three of them. Even when he 
spoke to the guard shack, he was never told there was a vehicle in the lot. He believed the suspects were on foot.
I asked Ofc. Ortega, at what point did he realize both of his partners were okay? He replied, “Once I stopped firing.” 
He said he knew Ofc. Macias was right next to him, but he had no idea where Ofc. Bourassa was at. Ofc. Ortega 
said he did not know if Ofc. Bourassa was hurt or injured until he saw him running back towards his direction, after 
the shooting.
I asked Ofc. Ortega if saw how many occupants were in the vehicle as it was driving past him, but he said no. I 
asked him if he recognized any of the suspects after they had been arrested and he said no.
Ofc. Ortega was asked why he deployed his rifle over his pistol. He stated he felt the rifle could provide capabilities 
that his pistol does not. Ofc. Ortega was asked, when the suspect vehicle first appeared, and they began to engage 
with it, where was Ofc. Macias. He replied, “Right by the driver's door.” Ofc. Ortega was asked what his target was 
after he engaged with the vehicle and he replied, “The driver's door.”
Ofc. Ortega was asked when he stopped shooting. He said as soon as the vehicle came to a stop, and he saw Ofc. 
Bourassa was not injured.
I asked Ofc. Ortega, why did he transition from his rifle to his pistol? He stated because his rifle no longer had ammo. 
I asked him if he felt there was still a threat. Ofc. Ortega said there was still a potential threat because he had not 
cleared the suspect vehicle. However, he no longer shot at the vehicle.
We concluded the interview at 1619 hours. Ofc. Ortega was wearing his body-worn camera which was activated 
during the entire incident. Please refer to his body-worn camera for full details.

Case # 23-06009 - Supplement - 31 Report
NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
The following is a supplemental report to Detective Ortiz's report. The purpose of this report is to document my 
response to an officer involved shooting, my actions upon my response, and interviews with South County Fire 
personnel who responded to the scene.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/19/2023 at approximately 0500 hours, I was dispatched to respond to the Tracy Police Department from my 
home residence for an officer involved shooing that occurred at the Best Buy warehouse located at 6653 Hopkins Rd 
in the City of Tracy.
Upon my arrival to the Tracy Police Department I was briefed on what occurred and I was partnered with Detective 
Zuniga with Tracy PD and Misty Springmeyer with the San Joaquin County District Attorneys Office.
One of the tasks I was assigned was to review and create a timeline of the available video from the Best Buy 
warehouse. Said video was already collected and booked into the Tracy Police Department evidence facility by 
Crime Scene Technician Pedro Valles. I logged into Axon Evidence and reviewed the video. Below is a timeline of 
said video.

side of Best Buy and the headlights to the vehicle turn off.
32:45 Suspect vehicle parks in front of the gate on the northwest side of Best Buy. A subject wearing a black 
sweatshirt, blue jeans, and black shoes exits the rear driver side of the vehicle and walks towards the gate 
holding what appears to be bold cutters. The bolt cutters were unable to remove the lock securing the gate, so 
the subject returns to the vehicle and re enters through the same door he exited.
32:57 Suspect vehicle begins to back away from the locked and secured gate. Suspect vehicle then 
repositions just to the north of the gate and the same subject exits the vehicle and walks to the rear passenger 
side of the vehicle.

at all"". Justin said when he arrived on scene AMR, police Officers with Tracy PD, and the San Joaquin County 
Sheriff's Department were already on scene. Justin located an adult male laying on the back side of Best Buy next to 
a vehicle. The male had obvious gunshot wounds, an obvious femur fracture to his leg, and a tourniquet on his leg.

reading Sergio his Miranda rights per my Miranda card. I asked Sergio if he understood his rights and he said, 
“Yeah.”
I asked Sergio if he knew why I wanted to talk to him and he said, “No.” I asked him if he knew why he was in the 
hospital and he replied, “I got shot. I dived from the back seat to the front so I could cover my friend.” Sergio stated 
he did not know what location they were at because he was sleeping. I asked him if he remembered how many times 
he was shot at and he said, “Like 6 or 7 shots.” I asked him to clarify if he heard 6 to 7 shots or if he believed he was 
struck 6 to 7 times. He said he believed he was shot 6 to 7 times.
I asked Sergio to tell me what he did before arriving to Tracy. He told me he was at his house in Oakland when he 
decided to pick up several items from his house in Tracy. Sergio said he was drinking Hennessy alcohol and fell 
asleep. I asked Sergio who was he with and he named, Brenda, “Chema” and “Mazapan (AKA Chitapan).” I asked 
Sergio what his nickname was, and he replied, “Tricky.”
Sergio told one, that once the four of them were together, they got into Mazapan’s Infiniti SUV. Mazapan was driving. 
Brenda was in the front seat. Sergio and Chema were seated in the back seat. Sergio said he was sleeping until he 
heard the gunshots, followed by Brenda screaming. The next thing he heard was Brenda telling the police officers to 
take him to the hospital.
I asked Sergio if he remembered getting out of the vehicle. He said he remembered when Brenda opened the door, 
they both fell out. I asked him how he broke both of his legs and he said, “Probably when I fell.” Sergio said he had 
no idea where he was at or why he was shot at.
I told Sergio I had already spoken to Brenda and Jose (AKA Chema), and I knew he was lying to me. I told Sergio 
the Best Buy warehouse had cameras that captured everything from the moment he backed into the two trailers. I 
told Sergio I knew he was not sleeping and asked him if he wanted to tell me once more what happened.
Sergio changed his story and stated that Chitapan woke him up and told him to “back up the truck.” The next thing 
Sergio heard was someone yell, “Motherfucker get on the floor.” He said the yelling was followed by someone

running towards them and then he heard shots. Sergio said he left the car on drive, and then threw his body over 
Brenda. He stated in the past, he dated Brenda’s mother so he did not want anything to happen to her because he 
would not know how to tell her mother. Sergio then said, “I’m sorry.”
I asked Sergio if he knew who was yelling at him and he replied, “I think they were Sheriffs.” He said he heard his 
friends telling him to “Go and then gas, but I wasn’t going to hurt anyone you know.” He said he does not carry a gun 
and he is not on probation. He said he never wanted to injure or kill anyone, and he did not understand why he got 
shot at when he did not have a gun. I told Sergio he used the vehicle as a weapon. He asked how. I told him he 
came close to killing two police officers who he almost ran over. He replied, “How? I never drove?” I told Sergio there 
was video that captured him driving, and he replied, “I don’t remember.”
I asked Sergio if saw the police officers in front of his vehicle when they were shouting at him and he said, “No 
because we were in between two trailers. I didn’t see them. But if I did, I’m really sorry about it. I would never 
jeopardize nobody’s life.” I told Sergio, that when he accelerated the vehicle toward the officers and almost ran them 
over is the reason why the police officers fired their firearms in his direction. Sergio said, “I really wanna say I’m 
sorry. If that’s the case, that was not my intention. When they shot, I got scared.”
I began asking Sergio about the fourth passenger who was still outstanding. I told Sergio I believed the outstanding 
suspect was his brother Jose Garibay. Sergio told me Jose Garibay was not with him, and that I am confusing him. 
He stated that Mazapan is also known as “Chitapan.” Sergio asked me, “Why don’t you just ask Brenda? That’s her 
man.” I told him Brenda was asked but she would not tell us.
I asked Sergio how long Brenda has been in a relationship with Chitapan and he said approximately one year. I 
asked if he knew if they had kids together and he said, ""No."" Sergio described Chitapan as a Hispanic male, with 
long hair, pimples on his face, and is approximately 27 years of age. He said he has a long scar on the right side of 
his cheek. He stated he believed Chitapan was from Hayward and knew he had been incarcerated at Santa Rita jail. 
The last thing Sergio said about Chitapan was that he believed his name was Dany or Daniel. Sergio stated he 
believed Chitapan was the actual driver of the vehicle.
This concluded the interview with Sergio. I told him he was being charged with two counts of PC 245(C)- Assault on 
an officer, PC- 459 Burglary, PC- 182 Conspiracy to commit a crime, and PC148 for attempting to flee. Sergio said 
he understood.
After the interview, DAI Sant and I drove to the San Joaquin County Jail (999 W. Mathews Rd.) in French Camp. 
While at county jail, I met with (A) Jose Aguilar once again. I introduced Jose to TPD Ofc. Velasquez, and told him 
she would be showing him several photos. I then stepped out of the interview room. Ofc. Velasquez showed Jose a 
photo lineup that contained a photo of Jose Garibay, who is the brother of Sergio Garibay. I believed Jose Garibay 
was possibly the fourth and outstanding suspect known as Chitapan. After a few moments, Ofc. Velasquez stepped 
out of the interview room and told me Jose Aguilar did not pick anyone from the lineup.
I entered the interview room and read Jose his Miranda rights per my TPD card. I asked Jose if he understood the 
rights I read him and he said, “Yes.” I told Jose I wanted to know more about “Chitapan” and where to find him. Jose 
told me he was not sure where to find him but said the description he had provided me the day of his arrest was still 
accurate. He told me “The photos you showed me had Tricky’s (Sergio) brother, but he wasn’t with us that night.”
I asked Jose if he remembered when he had been incarcerated with Chitapan and he said in May of 2023 at Santa 
Rita Jail. Jose was unable to provide any further information. This concluded the interview with Jose Aguilar.
On 11/24/23, at approximately 1530 hours, I received a phone call from Kaiser San Leandro. I was told, Sergio 
Garibay would be ready for discharge the following day 11/25/23.
On 11/25/23, Ofc. Galindo and Ofc. De Loza drove to Kaiser San Leandro and picked up Sergio. Sergio was 
transported and booked in county jail.

NARRATIVE
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:
This supplemental report was written to document the process on obtaining the Crash Data Report from the 2021 
Infinity QX80 (V-1) involved in the Officer Involved shooting.
NARRATIVE:
On 11/29/2023, Detective Ortiz contacted me via email inquiring about the Event Data Recorder (EDR) commonly 
referred to as, "" Black Box"".
I spoke to Det. Ortiz about the EDR, air bag control module (ACM), Power Control Module, and possible recording 
the events of the crash on V-1. I told 
I can attempt to image any recorded events on the EDR. Det. 
Det. Ortiz 
Azevedo wrote a search warrant for the silver, 2021 Infiniti QX80. Judge Villapudua signed the search warrant on 11
/30/2023 at 0811 hours.
On 11/30/2023 at approximately 1240 hours, I checked the Bosh Crash Data software to ensure V-1 was supported 
by the software. After confirming V-1 was supported, I used the Bosch Crash Data Retrieval tool and our unit laptop 
to plug into V-1’s on board diagnostics port (OBD). Once I plugged into the OBD, I inputted all of V-1’s information 
into the software and started the imaging process. The software located one (1) recorded event on the ACM and 
imaged the recorded information. The event that was imaged from V-1 was saved as a PDF file, printed, and 
attached to this report.
On page 17, of the Crash Data report, under ""
the EDR recorded the 
Pre-Crash Data -5 to 0 Sec (Event Record 1)"", 
speed of V-1 prior to impacting the curb and fire hydrant. The report was broken down in half second intervals, 
starting with five (5) seconds prior to impact. At -5.0 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 1.9 MPH, 2% accelerator 
pedal. Brakes were not activated. At -4.5 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 1.9 MPH, 32% accelerator pedal. 
Brakes were not activated. At -4.0 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 4.3 MPH, 100% accelerator pedal. Brakes 
were not activated. At -3.5 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 9.3 MPH, 6% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not 
activated. At -3.0 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 9.3 MPH, 63% accelerator pedal. Brakes were activated. At 
-2.5 seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 7.5 MPH, 100% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated. At -2.0 
seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 10.6 MPH, 100% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated. At 1.5 
seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 17.4 MPH, 100% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated. At -1.0 
seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 14.9 MPH, 100% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated. At -0.5 
seconds, V-1's speed was recorded at 21.7 MPH, 0% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated. At -0.0 seconds, 
V-1's speed was recorded at 18.6 MPH, 0% accelerator pedal. Brakes were not activated.

Case # 23-06009 - Supplement - 35 Report
NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
The purpose of this supplemental report is to further support that the methamphetamine located was possessed with 
the intent to sell.
NARRATIVE:
On 12/02/2023, I was contacted by Detective Ortiz regarding the located narcotics from inside the suspect’s 2021 
Infinity Qx80 SUV
). Detective Ortiz advised me that a total of 36.5 grams of suspected 
methamphetamine was located inside the vehicle.
Due to my training and experience of narcotics and the usage amount of a common user, I advised her of my opinion 
that 36.5 grams of methamphetamine was likely possessed with the intention for sales.
An avid methamphetamine user, who uses every day, commonly from 0.3 grams per day, up to as much as 1 gram 
per day. (1) Usable amount of methamphetamine is (0.1) -(0.25) grams. This equates to the possessed amount 
ranging from 146-365 usable amounts depending on the user. This also equates to approximately121 days worth of 
methamphetamine at 0.3 grams per day or 36 days worth of methamphetamine if the user is at 1 gram per day.
In my opinion, given my training and experience, this was more than the average user will have in their possession at 
a time. It is in my opinion that Garibay possessed a much larger amount of narcotics that a normal drug user would 
.
possess for personal use. I believe the amount of narcotics that Garibay possessed was for sales

NARRATIVE
SUMMARY:
The purpose of this supplemental report is to book property for safekeeping. Per conversation with Officer Bourassa, 
the items were located on (A) Brenda Prado's person.

Since Officer Bourassa was the last officer who drove the vehicle, I spoke with him to ask him were the items were 
from. Officer Bourassa advised the items were located on (A) Brenda Prado's person. The items included nine ""$1"" 
bills and one ""$10"" bill, a ""QR"" code receipt, a CA Driver License belonging to 
 and a hotel key 
card to Bay Breeze.

NARRATIVE

Portions of this contact were recorded utilizing my patrol vehicles in dash Axon camera.

Due to rapidly evolving events, | was unable to get my body worn camera at the Salinas Police
Department for this contact.

On 10/20/2023 at approximately hours | was in duty as a Salinas Police Officer assigned to the K-9
unit with my police K-9 Bolt. | was in full uniform and driving a marked Salinas Police Department
patrol vehicle.

At this time, | was contacted by Sergeant R.Sanchez and he told me that California Highway Patrol
was in pursuit of a vehicle, and they were requesting the assistance of a K-9. Prior to leaving the
police department I was informed that the subject in the pursuit was wanted for assault of deadly
weapon on an officer with a vehicle.

As | left the Salinas Police department, | responded code three, and the vehicle was N/B on N.Davis
Rd approaching E.Blanco Rd. The direction of travel was updated to E/B on E Blanco Rd towards E.
Alisal St. | set up at the intersection of Lorimer St / E.Alisal St and saw that the pursuit was coming in
my direction E/B on E/Alisal St. As the pursuit passed me with three California Highway Patrol units in

| asked Monterey County communications if the California Highway Patrol wanted Salinas P.D. to take
over the pursuit. California Highway Patrol said that they wanted Salinas P.D. to take over the pursuit.

| advised County communications that I was going to be taking over the pursuit at the intersection of E.
Alisal St / Church St where | assumed the number one position in the pursuit and Sergeant Roman
was in the number two position. The driver of the vehicle later identified as Ruben Ayon led Salinas
Police Officers on a 1.38-mile pursuit through south Salinas.

Please refer to Sergeant Roman's report for further details of the pursuit and his observations.

| am currently trained and certified in the Pursuit intervention technique with the Salinas Police
Department. | attempted to PIT Ayon numerous times however every time | attempted the PIT Ayon
either slammed on his breaks or drove from side to side within the curb lines avoiding the PIT.

When we reached the area of Alameda Dr and E Romie Lane Sergeant Roman passed me on the
right-hand side and attempted the Pursuit intervention technique and temporarily immobilized Ayon's
vehicle. After the PIT maneuver Ayon's vehicle ended up facing in a W/B direction on the west curb
line on Alameda Ave in the driveway of 339 E. Romie Ln. Ayon then put the vehicle into drive and tried
to go around my patrol car, but | pulled forward and forced his vehicle to go back into the driveway as
he attempted to go through the sidewalk but was blocked partially by my patrol car and a fixed light
pole. At this time Sergeant Roman pulled his vehicle directly behind Ayon and Ayon backed into him.
Ayon pulled forward and created space between Sergeant Roman's patrol car. Sergeant Roman and |
exited our patrol cars and challenged Ayon at gun point. Ayon then accelerated in reverse as
Sergeant Roman was getting back into his vehicle and rammed Sergeant Roman. Sergeant Roman
was able to push Ayon's vehicle with his patrol car onto a tree causing the front tires to be off the
ground.

| exited my patrol car and once again challenged Ayon to put his hands up. Ayon refused to put his
hands up and started to press on the accelerator and manipulate the gear shifter. | could see the front
tires spinning as Ayon was pressing on the accelerator and was also moving the steering wheel left
and right as if he was trying to disengage the vehicle from the tree. Ayon continually reached under
the seat to the vehicle on both sides. The vehicle was resting on top of a tree at an angle which also
made it difficult to see Ayon's hands. Officers kept challenging Ayon to put his hands up however he
refused and kept reaching under the seat.

Officer J.Munoz arrived on scene and had broken right front passenger window out with a 40mm
round. Ayon still refused to put his hands up and Officer Munoz broke right rear passenger window as
well in attempts to find a way into the vehicle to deploy K-9 Bolt. Detective Scaggs, who was also on
scene, gave Ayon a K9 announcement however he refused to comply with commands.

K-9 Bolt was used for the following reasons:

The suspect was actively resisting arrest and evading officers. Based on the fact that Ayon had
demonstrated his willingness to endanger the lives of the public and the responding officers showing
no regard for the safety of others and that Ayon was an unsearched felony suspect who had
committed a serious offense, | deployed K-9 Bolt into the vehicle to apprehend Ayon.

Report # 23-100611 - Incident Report Report Cover Sheet Salinas Police Department Pg 4 of 5

It was my fear that if Ayon was to get back on the road, he would pose an immediate danger to
officers and the public safety once again.

The use of the K-9 also greatly decreased the threat to officers and the public during the apprehension
of suspect Ayon.

The use of the K-9 Bolt was the less than lethal force option.

After K-9 Bolt was in the vehicle he apprehended Ayon by biting him on the right upper arm. |
approached the vehicle from the passenger side and due to the fact that the vehicle was inclined |
could not enter the vehicle from the passenger side. | ran around the vehicle and made my way to the
driver's side door. | had to push the back sliding door open to get into the vehicle. | instructed the
Officers that were assisting me to pull Ayon out of the vehicle. Once Ayon was taken out of the vehicle
| gave K-9 Bolt the release command and he released from the bite.

| then secured K-9 Bolt in the rear of my patrol car and went back to assist with Ayon.

Medical personnel were already on scene and when the scene was secure, they tended to Ayon's
injuries. Ayon was transported to Natividad Hospital for a jail clearance and his injuries.

When I contacted Ayon at the hospital, | advised him of his Miranda rights and the following is a
summary of his statement: | asked Ayon why he didn't stop for that patrol cars that were pursing him
because he was afraid of the police because they had originally tried to take him out of the car in
Marina. Ayon said that the Marina cops have been dicks to him in the past and today they pointed a
gun at him to get him out of the car therefore he fled from them. Ayon said that when he was on
highway 68 the officers had stopped chasing him and he pulled into the Toro Park residential area.
Ayon said when he drove out of the Toro Park residential area CHP had started to pursue him again.

| asked Ayon if he saw the line of patrol cars behind him and he said that he didn't because the mirror
was not in the right position. | told Ayon that I had tried to PIT his vehicle several times however he
kept braking and then accelerating. | asked Ayon where he was driving to, and Ayon responded and
said that he didn't have a plan and was going to continue driving until officers stopped chasing him. |
asked after his vehicle was PIT why did he continue to attempt to escape. Ayon said that he didn't
know what he was thinking, and he was sorry that he made a stupid mistake. | asked Ayon why he
kept reaching under the seats when officers were challenging him to put his hands up. Ayon said that
he was trying to gather all of his money and put it all in his wallet because it was his life savings. | told
Ayon that | even gestured to him with my hands up and see if would put his hands up and he refused.
Ayon asked me what his charges and | were gave them to him and he said that he was sorry and he
made a mistake.

| confronted Ayon about a large number of blue pills with an imprint of M30 on it. | asked Ayon if they
were M30 pills and he said that they were. Ayon said that everything illegal in the vehicle belonged to
him.

Please refer to Officer |. Urquizo's supplement report for further details of his findings of the
contraband.

NARRATIVE
Evidence:

Upon contact with Ayon, | activated my Body Worn Camera and downloaded it to Evidence.com.

Narrative:

On the above date and time, | responded to the area of Alameda and Romie Lane to assist in the
arrest of Ruben Ayon Jr. For further details of the pursuit, see the master report.

Before my arrival, the Officer informed County Communications that Ayon had rammed his vehicle
into the Officer's vehicle.

The following is a summary of my involvement. See my BWC for further details.

Upon arrival, | observed that Ayon's Honda Odyssey was pushed onto a small tree, and a fully marked
police vehicle was behind it. | pulled out my gun and observed Ayon reaching under his seat and
looking for what | thought was a gun.

Surrounding Officers had their guns out, pointed at Ayon, and ordered him repeatedly to put his hands
up. Ayon continued to look and reach around the cab of his vehicle and did not comply with orders to
put his hands up.

| de-escalated and, holstered my gun and pulled out my department-issued 40mm foam munition. |
fired two rounds at the front passenger window, and the projectiles bounced off the window. The third
round shattered the front window. | shot the fourth and final round at the passenger rear window,
which shattered. Ayon still did not comply and was attempting to move his vehicle. He had it in gear,
and the front wheels were spinning as he tried to drive his vehicle.

This concluded my part in this investigation, and for further details, see my BWC.

Supplement Pursuit and P.I.T. maneuver

SUPPLEMENT TYPE

General - arrest assist

NARRATIVE

On 10-20-23, | was assigned as the sergeant supervising our Day Watch Shift. At approximately 1426
hours, Monterey County Dispatch advised me of C.H.P.'s involvement in a pursuit and requested a K-
9 officer. The want on the suspect was assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. K-9 Officer
Anthony Garcia was about to start since Second Watch was at the station. | and K-9 Officer Garcia
responded from the police station Code 3 towards the pursuit.

At approximately 1433 hours, we caught up to the pursuit at E. Alisal St and Homestead Ave. The
suspect vehicle, a silver Honda Odyssey, CA plate #1, was traveling eastbound on E. Alisal
St. with three CHP units pursuing the vehicle. The suspect vehicle ran a red light at the intersection. |
and Officer Garcia began to trail the pursuit. At E. Alisal St. and Riker Ave. CHP requested us to take
over the pursuit. Officer Garcia is PIT-trained and informed me he would attempt a P.I.T. maneuver on
the vehicle. | acknowledge Officer Garcia’s traffic. The following is the direction of travel and the

Alameda Ave and Hawthorne St. - P.I.T. Manuever on Suspect Vehicle.

During the pursuit, | observed Officer Garcia attempting to place himself in a position to conduct a P.I.
T. maneuver. The suspect kept zig-zagging and would drive on the opposite side of the roadway to
prevent Officer Garcia from conducting the P.I.T. maneuver. | observed in the area of Pajaro St., at
least once, the suspect vehicle went into the opposite lane, and a vehicle was coming from the
opposite direction. That vehicle pulled to the curb to get out of the way.

As we were traveling southbound on Alameda Ave. | knew if we continued straight, we were going to
go into a school zone. | am currently trained and certified in the Pursuit intervention technique with the
Salinas Police Department. At Alameda Ave. and Hawthorne St. Officer Garcia attempted to P.I.T. the
vehicle, and the suspect slammed his brakes, reducing his speed considerably. Officer Garcia had
also slowed down as well. The suspect took off again, and since | hadn’t slowed down yet, |
accelerated, which helped me catch up to the suspect vehicle and placed my S.U.V. in a position to
conduct the P.I.T. maneuver. | placed my front push bumper on the right rear wheel well area, and |
successfully P.I.T. the suspect vehicle into the driveway of 339 E. Romie Lane.

The driveway to the residence faced Alameda Ave. The suspect vehicle came to rest on a Toyota
Corolla parked just north of the driveway, causing minor damage to the vehicle's left rear taillight and
bumper area. | drove past the suspect vehicle, and | noticed there was a large gap behind the suspect
vehicle. | repositioned my S.U.V. to place my push bumper on the rear bumper of the suspect vehicle
to prevent his escape. As | did this, the suspect vehicle was in reverse and struck my push bumper.
Both Officer Garcia and | exited our vehicles and were yelling commands. | observed the suspect
vehicle start moving forward. | could see he had turned his wheels right, and | thought he was trying to
drive past a lamp pole on the sidewalk to get away from us. | jumped back into my S.U.V., at which
point | noticed that the suspect vehicle was in reverse and purposely rammed my vehicle. | observed
Officer Garcia standing to my right side by his patrol vehicle, and the suspect was trying to turn in that
direction. | felt that he was going to ram or strike Officer Garcia with his vehicle in his attempt to
escape. | placed my SUV in drive and used the push bumper to push the van forward into a lemon
tree directly in front of the suspect vehicle. This caused the van’s front end to lift up, and due to it
being front-wheel drive, the front two tires no longer had contact with the ground and had no traction.

Report # 23-100611 - Supplement - 4 Report Salinas Police Department Pg 3 of 5

| exited my patrol vehicle, updated our location, and drew my firearm. The suspect remained in the
driver's seat. | could see that he was moving around, and it appeared he was trying to conceal
something on his person or near the area where he was seated. | could see both using his driver-side
mirror and through the rear window. | noticed that, at one point, he was moving the driver-side mirror
to see where | was at. | also observed that he was still trying to move the suspect vehicle. | could see
and hear him accelerating the suspect vehicle, which caused the tires to spin. | also observed the tires
moving side to side like he was moving the steering wheel. During this time, Officer Garcia was yelling
commands and also updating how much movement there was from the suspect in the driver-side
area.

As officers arrived, Officer Garcia coordinated with officers and Officer Munoz to break the passenger
side windows. Officer Munoz shot two 40mm less lethal rounds to the front passenger side window,
and both rounds bounced upward. The third 40mm less lethal round broke the front window. A fourth
40mm less lethal round broke the rear passenger window. As officers arrived, I informed them that the
40mm launcher was being used due to the sound sounding like gunfire and not wanting officers to
confuse it with gunfire.

After the windows were broken, Officer Garcia placed K-9 Bolt in the vehicle. Initially, Officer Garcia,
Officer Skaggs, Officer R. Miller, and Officer Munoz approached the vehicle's right passenger side.
Officer Garcia attempted to open the vehicle's sliding door, but it was jammed. Officer Garcia, Officer
Urquizo, and Detective Skaggs repositioned to the left side of the suspect vehicle. | approached them
as they were having difficulty removing the suspect from the vehicle. As they took the suspect down to
the ground, K-9 Bolt held the suspect's right shoulder. | saw blood on the suspect, and officers
grabbed his arms. | placed my knee between his shoulders so officers could cuff him.

AMR and Fire responded to the scene, and eventually, the suspect was transported by AMR to NMC
for treatment of the dog bite.

A vehicle search was conducted, and an item containing contraband and illegal drugs was located by
the driver-side seat. For further details, refer to Officer Urquizo’s supplement report. | observed the
suspect's cell phone was on the ground by the driver's side. This item was booked into evidence by
CSO Quintero. CSO Stephanie Moore took photographs of the scene.

California Towing towed the suspect vehicle. | observed after removing my SUV. The damage to the
vehicle only appeared to be to the push bumper. The left side of the push bumper was pushed inward,
almost touching the surface of the front grill area.

It should be mentioned when the suspect vehicle was pushed into the lemon tree; the tree fell on a
arked vehicle in the driveway a That vehicle is a 2012 white BMW, Lic plate #
We were unable to verify if there was body damage to the vehicle due to the tree limbs
covering the vehicle. Officer Munoz contacted the neighbor, who spoke with the owner of the BMW by
phone. A report number was provided to the neighbor for the owner of the vehicle.

| spoke with Sgt. Jeff Carr of Marina PD. He provided me with some details regarding their case. | was
informed that they would submit a booking sheet to Monterey County Jail for the charges incurred by
the suspect in their jurisdiction. For further details, refer to Marina PD Case # 23-2228.

NARRATIVE

On 09/23/2023 (Saturday) at approximately 0223 hours, | (Officer Rodriguez; B21) was on patrol in
the City of Elk Grove, which is in Sacramento County. | was dressed in my Elk Grove Police
Department uniform, and | was in a fully marked Elk Grove Police Department patrol vehicle, which
was equipped with an in-car camera (ICC). | was wearing a body worn camera device affixed to my
uniform, and it recorded during this investigation.

| was dispatched to a suspicious person at (. The text of the call stated an unknown
subject was banging on the door, and actively kicking the door. The text of the call also stated the
front door was now kicked in to the residence and the reporting party (later identified as Eunice
APPLING) was asked twice by dispatch if she knew the subject, and APPLING stated she did not.

Due to the text of the call, | responded code 3 with my patrol vehicles overhead lights and sirens from
the area of Babson Drive and Laguna Boulevard. Based on the text of the call, | initially thought the
call | was responding to could be a burglary in progress. Based on my training and experience, | know
suspects who burglarize homes are often times in possession of different tools to break into the
residence/building/structure. | know suspects who are in possession of these tools can use the tools
as weapons.

0227 hours: | arrived on scene and was also the first officer on scene. | decided to wait for an
additional unit prior to attempting contact at the call for service address. | wanted to wait for an
additional unit based upon the text of the call, and how if | went alone into the residence, it could pose
an immediate danger and officer safety issue. | waited at the northwest corner of Livorno Way and
Bellaterra Drive while other officers continued to respond to the call. | was directly two houses south of
the residence. As | was waiting for cover, | began to hear a female voice screaming very loudly from

. It appeared the female was possibly in distress by the sound of her voice being
high pitched, and how loud she was. Due to the exigent circumstance, | decided to run towards the
residence. As | was running towards the residence, | was thinking there was a potential home
invasion, or a potential burglary in progress and a female could possibly be hurt. | was in fear and
afraid of the possible outcome of what would happen inside of the residence. Although | was fearful of
what might happen inside of the residence, | felt it was necessary to go in due to the female
screaming and her potentially being hurt and or even killed.

As | approached the entry way to the residence, | observed the front door to be slightly cracked open.
As | was approaching the front door, | could still hear a female voice screaming from the interior of the
residence. | unholstered my department issued firearm from its hostler, pushed the front door open
with my right foot, and entered the residence. | began yelling out loud ""Elk Grove PD, Elk Grove PD""
so | could identify myself. | could still hear yelling and screaming towards the south side of the

residence. I began to walk towards the south hallway to the residence in an attempt to locate the 
female who was screaming and the person who had broken into the residence. 
As I was walking in the hallway, I could hear yelling and screaming still, but I could hear it from the first 
room to the right (north room) of the hallway. As I looked towards the room, I pointed my firearm 
towards it as well. I pointed my firearm towards the room because I was unaware if there was going to 
be a threat and I am trained to assume a potential burglary suspect, or home invasion suspect could 
be armed with a weapon. I was prepared to use deadly force if needed, especially since I was by 
myself and did not have a cover unit to have a less-lethal force option. Based on my training and 
experience, I know suspects who commit felony crimes such as home invasion and burglary are often 
times armed with guns, knives, and tools that can be used as a deadly weapon. 
As I pointed my firearm towards the room, I observed APPLING and a male subject (later identified as 
Leroy DANIELS) in the room standing next to each other. I immediately began to give commands to 
both DANIELS and APPLING telling them to put their hands up in the air in which they both initially 
complied. DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side after he originally had them up in the air. I 
once again raised my voice, telling DANIELS to place his hands up in the air in which he complied 
with, and raised them. APPLING was directly in front of DANIELS, yelling at me and attempting to gain 
my attention and focus towards her. I continued to place my focus towards DANIELS since I felt he 
was the potential suspect for breaking into the residence. I told DANIELS to come towards me and he 
screamed at me stating, ""for what man?"" DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side once 
again. I yelled at DANIELS once again stating to place his hands up in the air and he responded by 
yelling at me and saying, ""I am not going nowhere. Shoot me. Shoot me."" At this point I feared 
DANIELS was going to attempt to hurt me. Based on my training, I know people who want to commit 
suicide by cop often times want to attempt to kill the police officer, so the police officer in return could 
use deadly force on them. I feared DANIELS was concealing a weapon due to him placing his hands 
down by his side after I gave him multiple commands to keep his hands up in the air. When DANIELS 
told me to shoot him, I responded by saying I was not going to shoot him 
I continued to attempt to give commands to both subjects, but I was having difficulty due to there 
being two subjects and I was still alone, and they were both verbally uncooperative. I was able to 
slightly de-escalate the situation by lowering my voice down and attempting to calm down APPLING 
and DANIELS. I still had both DANIELS and APPLING at gunpoint at this point and was waiting for 
backup officers to arrive on scene. 
When I looked at DANIELS, I noticed he was much larger than me in stature, and appeared he could 
also be much stronger than me. DANIELS appeared to be approximately 5'09 and 240lbs, while I am 
5'07 and 150lbs. 
Officer Crain (B32) arrived on scene to assist me with the call. 
Officer Crain told APPLING to walk towards him, in which she did, and he began to escort her away 
from the hallway towards the main living room. Once APPLING was out of the bedroom in which her 
and DANIELS were originally located in, I told DANIELS to place his hands up and turn around. 
DANIELS was irate and yelled, ""For what, bruh y'all niggas all in my house."" DANIELS approached 
me quickly as he was saying this. I feared DANIELS was going to attempt to strike me. I holstered my 
firearm and told DANIELS to turn around. DANIELS responded saying, ""For what? For what?"" As

DANIELS became within arms distance of me, I placed my right hand on his stomach and placed my 
left hand near his right upper arm area and turned him around so his back was facing me. I did this 
because I wanted DANIELS to turn around due to the fact I feared he was going to strike me and 
because I wanted to detain him in handcuffs. DANIELS willingly turned around for me and placed his 
own hands behind his back and I did not use any force when I grabbed him on his stomach and upper 
right arm. 
As I grabbed DANIELS hands to place them together so I could detain him in handcuffs, DANIELS 
tensed his body up, and began to forcefully remove his hands from my grip, towards the front of his 
body. Due to this, I lost grip of DANIELS hands. As I was losing grip of DANIELS hands, he began to 
yell out loud, ""Why are you arresting me bruh? Watch out bruh!"" DANIELS quickly turned towards me 
and was now looking at me face to face. I feared DANIEL was going to strike me, so I grabbed ahold 
of his upper part of his arms with both of my hands and pushed him against a wall. 
At this point Officer Crain attempted to assist me in detaining DANIELS. I observed DANIELS swing 
and punch Officer Crain with a closed left-fist on the right side of Officer Crain's cheek. Based on my 
knowledge, training, and experience, I know a closed fist punch to the face is very likely to cause great 
bodily injury. I then observed Officer Crain begin to wrap his arms around DANIELS, but DANIELS 
was still attempting to strike Officer Crain. I considered the following prior to striking DANIELS: 
DANIELS was suspected of breaking into the residence, which is a serious crime. 
DANIELS was unsearched and it was unknown if he was concealing any weapons on his 
person. 
DANIELS had already told me to ""shoot him"" and I feared he would do an action that would 
cause me to use deadly force. 
DANIELS had already resisted uniformed police officers by tensing his body up, and forcefully 
removing his hands from my grip. 
DANIELS had swung and punched Officer Crain who is a uniformed police officer, in the face 
with a closed fist, which is a felony due to him resisting with violence. This attack on Officer 
Crain could have potentially caused great bodily injury to him. 
After I considered the above-mentioned information, I delivered a strike to DANIELS face with a 
closed right fist. It appeared the strike was ineffective, due to DANIELS still attempting to resist and 
get out of Officer Crains grip. 
After I struck DANIELS in the face, Officer Crain was able to take DANIELS to the ground. Officer 
Crain landed on the top of DANIELS, and DANIELS back was originally on the ground, and he was 
facing up. It appeared to me DANIELS was attempting to overpower Officer Crain by attempting to get 
out from under him. 
I quickly moved towards the right side of DANIELS body. DANIELS continued to resist by flailing his 
body, turning his body towards me, and attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain. Due to 
DANIELS continuing to resist by attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain, flailing his body, 
and him already punching Officer Crain in the face, which is a felony crime. I delivered a right elbow 
strike to the right side of DANIELS face. It appeared the elbow strike was affective this time. DANIELS 
did not place his hands behind his back right away, but he was no longer attempting to flail his body 
and get out from under neath Officer Crain. I began to give DANIELS commands telling him I would

on it to make sure he did not attempt to get up again. DANIELS then placed his right arm behind his
back, and | was able to place his right hand in a handcuff. Officer Crain had control of DANIELS left
arm and | was able to place his left hand in a handcuff as well, placing him under arrest at 0230 hours.

As | was initially placing pressure on the back of DANIELS head so he would not attempt to get back
up, he began to say he could not breathe. DANIELS kept repeating himself that he could not breathe.
DANIELS airway was not obstructed by anything and as soon as DANIELS was in handcuffs, both
Officer Crain and | got off of his back. After DANIELS was in handcuffs, | turned him towards his side
so he could be in a better position to breathe since he was stating he could not breathe. At this point |
observed DANIELS to be bleeding from his face. | also observed blood on the carpet where his face
near during the altercation. Due to DANIELS suffering facial injuries, | requested Fire Personnel to
respond to the scene so they could evaluate him. | also requested a supervisor to the scene so the
use of force would be documented.

| conducted a pat down of DANIELS person for weapons and did not locate any. | sat DANIEL up and
he was sitting on his own for a couple seconds. | then assisted DANIELS up from the ground and
escorted him out of the residence towards my patrol vehicle. | conducted a search incident to arrest of
DANIELS person and did not locate any illegal items. After searching DANIELS, | placed him in the
rear of a marked patrol vehicle.

While waiting for Fire Personnel to arrive at the scene, | began to speak to Officer Crain to ask if he
was okay. Officer Crain appeared to be suffering pain already from being punched by DANIELS.
Officer Crain was complaining of having a headache, and being dizzy. Furthermore, | observed red
swelling to the right side of Officer Crain's right cheek as we were still on scene.

Cosumnes Fire Personnel (CSD) responded to the scene and evaluated DANIELS, and then cleared
from the scene. Due to DANIELS visible injuries, DANIELS was going to need to get medically cleared
prior to being booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail.

Based on DANIELS resisting arrest with violence, and punching Officer Crain in the face causing
visible injury, DANIELS was in violation of the following charges:

* PC 69 - Resisting an executive officer.
© PC 243(c)(2) - Battery on peace officer.

Officer Taylor (B42) assisted me in the investigation. Officer Taylor spoke to APPLING, positively
identified her, and obtained her statement. APPLING told Officer Taylor that her and DANIELS are
married, and DANIELS lives at i with APPLING. Officer Taylor also found out
APPLING purposefully locked DANIELS out of his own residence and had previous knowledge that he
was going to attempt to come home. Refer to Officer Taylor's supplemental report.

Officer Hanna (B31) also spoke to APPLING and obtained a statement from her as well. APPLING
told Officer Hanna she knew it was originally her husband, DANIELS, that was attempting to gain
entry into his own home. APPLING went on to state that she did not initially tell dispatchers that she
knew it was her husband who was attempting to gain entry into his own residence. Refer to Officer
Hanna's supplemental report for further information.

listen to the audio of the two 911 phone calls APPLING made in regard to this incident. As | was

down by his side after I gave him multiple commands to keep his hands up in the air. When DANIELS 
told me to shoot him, I responded by saying I was not going to shoot him 
I continued to attempt to give commands to both subjects, but I was having difficulty due to there 
being two subjects and I was still alone, and they were both verbally uncooperative. I was able to 
slightly de-escalate the situation by lowering my voice down and attempting to calm down APPLING 
and DANIELS. I still had both DANIELS and APPLING at gunpoint at this point and was waiting for 
backup officers to arrive on scene. 
When I looked at DANIELS, I noticed he was much larger than me in stature, and appeared he could 
also be much stronger than me. DANIELS appeared to be approximately 5'09 and 240lbs, while I am 
5'07 and 150lbs. 
Officer Crain (B32) arrived on scene to assist me with the call. 
Officer Crain told APPLING to walk towards him, in which she did, and he began to escort her away 
from the hallway towards the main living room. Once APPLING was out of the bedroom in which her 
and DANIELS were originally located in, I told DANIELS to place his hands up and turn around. 
DANIELS was irate and yelled, ""For what, bruh y'all niggas all in my house."" DANIELS approached 
me quickly as he was saying this. I feared DANIELS was going to attempt to strike me. I holstered my 
firearm and told DANIELS to turn around. DANIELS responded saying, ""For what? For what?"" As 
DANIELS became within arms distance of me, I placed my right hand on his stomach and placed my 
left hand near his right upper arm area and turned him around so his back was facing me. I did this 
because I wanted DANIELS to turn around due to the fact I feared he was going to strike me and 
because I wanted to detain him in handcuffs. DANIELS willingly turned around for me and placed his 
own hands behind his back and I did not use any force when I grabbed him on his stomach and upper 
right arm. 
As I grabbed DANIELS hands to place them together so I could detain him in handcuffs, DANIELS 
tensed his body up, and began to forcefully remove his hands from my grip, towards the front of his 
body. Due to this, I lost grip of DANIELS hands. As I was losing grip of DANIELS hands, he began to 
yell out loud, ""Why are you arresting me bruh? Watch out bruh!"" DANIELS quickly turned towards me 
and was now looking at me face to face. I feared DANIEL was going to strike me, so I grabbed ahold 
of his upper part of his arms with both of my hands and pushed him against a wall. 
At this point Officer Crain attempted to assist me in detaining DANIELS. I observed DANIELS swing 
and punch Officer Crain with a closed left-fist on the right side of Officer Crain's cheek. Based on my 
knowledge, training, and experience, I know a closed fist punch to the face is very likely to cause great 
bodily injury. I then observed Officer Crain begin to wrap his arms around DANIELS, but DANIELS 
was still attempting to strike Officer Crain. I considered the following prior to striking DANIELS: 
DANIELS was suspected of breaking into the residence, which is a serious crime. 
DANIELS was unsearched and it was unknown if he was concealing any weapons on his 
person. 
DANIELS had already told me to ""shoot him"" and I feared he would do an action that would 
cause me to use deadly force.

Pg of

DANIELS had already resisted uniformed police officers by tensing his body up, and forcefully 
removing his hands from my grip. 
DANIELS had swung and punched Officer Crain who is a uniformed police officer, in the face 
with a closed fist, which is a felony due to him resisting with violence. This attack on Officer 
Crain could have potentially caused great bodily injury to him. 
After I considered the above-mentioned information, I delivered a strike to DANIELS face with a 
closed right fist. It appeared the strike was ineffective, due to DANIELS still attempting to resist and 
get out of Officer Crains grip. 
After I struck DANIELS in the face, Officer Crain was able to take DANIELS to the ground. Officer 
Crain landed on the top of DANIELS, and DANIELS back was originally on the ground, and he was 
facing up. It appeared to me DANIELS was attempting to overpower Officer Crain by attempting to get 
out from under him. 
I quickly moved towards the right side of DANIELS body. DANIELS continued to resist by flailing his 
body, turning his body towards me, and attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain. Due to 
DANIELS continuing to resist by attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain, flailing his body, 
and him already punching Officer Crain in the face, which is a felony crime. I delivered a right elbow 
strike to the right side of DANIELS face. It appeared the elbow strike was affective this time. DANIELS 
did not place his hands behind his back right away, but he was no longer attempting to flail his body 
and get out from under neath Officer Crain. I began to give DANIELS commands telling him I would 
strike him again if he did not comply. I placed my right elbow behind DANIELS head and put pressure 
on it to make sure he did not attempt to get up again. DANIELS then placed his right arm behind his 
back, and I was able to place his right hand in a handcuff. Officer Crain had control of DANIELS left 
arm and I was able to place his left hand in a handcuff as well, placing him under arrest at 0230 hours. 
As I was initially placing pressure on the back of DANIELS head so he would not attempt to get back 
up, he began to say he could not breathe. DANIELS kept repeating himself that he could not breathe. 
DANIELS airway was not obstructed by anything and as soon as DANIELS was in handcuffs, both 
Officer Crain and I got off of his back. After DANIELS was in handcuffs, I turned him towards his side 
so he could be in a better position to breathe since he was stating he could not breathe. At this point I 
observed DANIELS to be bleeding from his face. I also observed blood on the carpet where his face 
near during the altercation. Due to DANIELS suffering facial injuries, I requested Fire Personnel to 
respond to the scene so they could evaluate him. I also requested a supervisor to the scene so the 
use of force would be documented. 
I conducted a pat down of DANIELS person for weapons and did not locate any. I sat DANIEL up and 
he was sitting on his own for a couple seconds. I then assisted DANIELS up from the ground and 
escorted him out of the residence towards my patrol vehicle. I conducted a search incident to arrest of 
DANIELS person and did not locate any illegal items. After searching DANIELS, I placed him in the 
rear of a marked patrol vehicle. 
While waiting for Fire Personnel to arrive at the scene, I began to speak to Officer Crain to ask if he 
was okay. Officer Crain appeared to be suffering pain already from being punched by DANIELS. 
Officer Crain was complaining of having a headache, and being dizzy. Furthermore, I observed red 
swelling to the right side of Officer Crain's right cheek as we were still on scene.

identified her, and obtained her statement. APPLING told Officer Taylor that her and DANIELS are
married, and DANIELS lives at i with APPLING. Officer Taylor also found out
APPLING purposefully locked DANIELS out of his own residence and had previous knowledge that he
was going to attempt to come home. Refer to Officer Taylor's supplemental report.

Officer Hanna (B31) also spoke to APPLING and obtained a statement from her as well. APPLING

supplemental report for further information.

| responded back to the Elk Grove Police Department and went into the dispatch center. | requested to
listen to the audio of the two 911 phone calls APPLING made in regard to this incident. As | was
listening to both audio recordings, never once does APPLING ever mention that it was her husband
who was attempting to gain entry into his own home. APPLING actually stated on multiple occasions
she did not know the subject attempting to break into her home, although she knew it was her
husband because they had gotten into a argument over the phone prior to him arriving to the house. |
later uploaded those audio recordings to Evidence.com.

Based upon the fact in which APPLING had prior knowledge it was DANIELS attempting to get back
into his own residence, APPLING lying to Elk Grove PD dispatchers stating on multiple occasions she

NARRATIVE

On 09/23/2023 |, Officer B. Crain (B32) was assigned as a Police Officer in the City of Elk Grove. |
was wearing a full police patrol uniform and was wearing a Body Worn Camera (BWC) which was
affixed to the front of my body, capturing events that occurred in front of me. | was in a marked City of
Elk Grove Police Vehicle (#213) which was equipped with overhead emergency lights. All equipment
was tested for functionality prior to the beginning of my shift.

On the above date at approximately 0224 hours, | responded to a report of a suspicious person at

. The text of the call provided by dispatch stated that the reporting party was calling
in and stating an unknown person was at her door and was kicking the door. The caller then advised
that her door was kicked in and the line to dispatch was disconnected.

Due to the information, | responded “Code 3” by activating my emergency lights and sirens.

As | was arriving on scene, | heard Officer C. Rodriguez (B21) air that he heard someone screaming
from inside the residence of the call location.

| arrived on scene at 0229 hours and ran up to the residence and saw the front door open. | entered
and observed that Officer Rodriguez had two subjects at gunpoint.

One was a black female, who was later identified as (S2) as Eunice APPLING. The second was a
black male, who was later identified as (S1) Leroy DANIELS.

| contacted APPLING and tried to escort her out of the area so that Officer Rodriguez and | could deal
with DANIELS. As | was escorting her out of the way, Officer Rodriguez began to contact DANIELS
and attempted to detain him in handcuffs.

| observed DANIELS begin to turn away from Officer Rodriguez and began pulling away from him.

| redirected my attention to DANIELS and reached out to grab his right arm. While doing this,
DANIELS struck me one (1) time with a closed fist with his left hand on the right side of my face.

At this time, | determined there was an immediate need to secure DANIELS and take him into custody
based upon the following factors.

DANIELS was suspected of breaking into the residence based upon the text of the call
DANIELS was physically resistant to a lawful detention by officers

DANIELS physically assaulted and struck a uniformed police officer

DANIELS had not been checked for any weapons

Based upon those factors, | wrapped my arms around DANIELS upper torso, and tackled DANIELS to
the ground, and mounted him and applied pressure to his hips with my body weight to keep him on the
ground.

While on top of DANIELS, | noticed APPLING walking up behind me and grabbed my exterior vest
carrier. | turned around and ordered her to step back. APPLING was yelling and screaming at me and
would not step back. | pulled out my AXON Taser 7 and activated it and pointed it at APPLING and
ordered to step back and exit the house.

APPLING complied and walked away. | holstered my Taser and continued to try and detain DANIELS.

| retrieved DANIELS’ left arm and placed it behind his back and held it in a straight armbar until his
right arm was able to be retrieved, and DANIELS was secured into handcuffs.

Once DANIELS was secured into handcuffs, additional officers arrived on scene and escorted him
outside.

| assisted with conducting a protective sweep of the residence. Nothing of evidentiary value was
located.

| exited the residence and Sergeant S. Wessel (S21) arrived on scene and | briefed him on the events.
| self-transported to Methodist Hospital (7500 Hospital Drive) for a medical evaluation due to having
pain to the right side of my face due to being struck by DANIELS. Once cleared from the hospital |
returned to the Elk Grove Police Department and Officer Rodriguez documented my injuries via
photographs. Refer to his primary report for further details.

***STATEMENT OF EUNICE APPLING TAKEN BY OFFICER TAYLOR*** 
You guys did too much. I just wanted you guys to tell him to calm down and to go for the night. They 
just hit him for no reason. I don  
want to press any charges. 
Me and my husband had a minor argument and things got out of control. He just got back from the 
club. 
Me and my husband have been married for about 10 years and we live here together. He wasn't at 
home and I was at home. We got into an argument over the phone. He came home from the club and 
I locked him out. I locked the front door and I was holding the front door closed. He got into the house 
and we went into our room so the kids wouldn't hear us. The kids were in another room and weren  
around. That's when you guys came in. 
He didn't hit me or anything. We were just arguing. I provoked the argument. I don't want to press 
charges. I don't want him to go to jail. 
The police came running in with guns and pointed guns at him. We were in the room arguing. The 
police said come out with your hands up. My husband told them to 
 
 
the fuck out of my house.  
I 
told them to please don  
shoot my husband. They told me to move to the side and I said no, please 
don  
shoot him. My husband was standing behind me. The officer told him to stand there with your 
hands up. My husband said 
 
 
you are in my fucking house?.  That  
when the officer hit him, 
slammed him against the wall, and slammed him onto the ground. 
***END OF STATEMENT*** 
While speaking with APPLING, I did not observe any visible injuries on her. APPLING denied medical 
care. I asked APPLING if I could take photos of her to document her nonexistent visible injuries, 
however, APPLING did not consent. 
I informed Officer Rodriguez of APPLING's statement. While informing Officer Rodriguez, Officer 
Hanna spoke with APPLING. See Officer Hanna's supplemental report for further details. 
I observed the front door and door frame to the residence. I observed the door frame was damaged, 
cracked and broken. There were fresh drywall particles on the ground near the broken door frame that 
were consistent with the front door being forced open. The front door of the residence had what 
appeared to be scuff marks near the center of the door. I did not observe any dents in the front door. I 
took photos of the door and frame and later uploaded them to Axon Evidence. 
Officer Rodriguez advised me he was placing DANIELS under arrest. 
Officer Hanna transported DANIELS to Kaiser South Permanente hospital to be medically evaluated. I 
followed Officer Hanna to the hospital and contacted DANIELS. I read DANIELS his miranda rights 
verbatim from my department issued miranda card. DANIELS stated ""yeah"" that he understood each 
of his rights. DANIELS stated that he did not want to talk to me.

eyebrow area was swollen with a circular sized welt that was approximately three inches in diameter.
His right eye was swollen closed. DANIELS had dried blood coming from out of his nose that was
consistent with his nose bleeding. DANIELS complained of pain to his right eye. | took photos of
DANIELS injuries and later uploaded them to Axon Evidence.

Doctor iii MD advised that DANIELS had an orbital fracture.
While DANIELS was being treated, CSI Kwuan arrived and photographed DANIELS injuries.

APPLING arrived at the hospital and requested the vehicle keys DANIELS had in his possession
because she advised she needed to move the vehicle so it wouldn't get towed for being parked
illegally. | asked DANIELS if it was ok for APPLING to take his keys and he consented. | gave the
keys to APPLING and she left the hospital.

DANIELS was treated and medically cleared for incarceration by Kaiser Permanente staff. | then

contacted Ernesto and saw him running Southbound on Reed Ave. (See OFC. Serrano report for further Case#23-
0564) 
 did inform me that Ernesto is currently on drugs.
Additional RPD officers on scene advised that they were out with Ernesto on Reed Ave. just south of Kip Patrick Ave. 
(See OFC. Nava (K27) and OFC. Escovedo (L42) report). I arrived on the scene and observed Ernesto lying on the 
ground with blood on the sidewalk. At approximately 2204 hours, SGT Puryear dispatched for EMS to respond code 
3 for Ernesto's injuries. (See SGT. Puryear's S82 report for further)
I observed two taser prongs inserted in Ernesto's body. One of the prongs was on the lower right side of his neck. 
The second prong was inserted in Ernesto's right side lower back. OFC. Jimenez and I stood by with Ernesto until 
EMS arrived on the scene. (See OFC. Jimenez (L68) report). At approximately 2202 hours, I advised Dispatch that

At approximately 2346 hours, Bayardo informed me that a CT scan was conducted on Ernesto's head area for 
severe injuries. The CT scan revealed Ernesto's skull cracked open, allowing oxygen to flow to the brain. Bayardo 
advised that this was causing a hematoma to set in and push the severe bruising to make his eyes purple and 
swollen shut. The CT scan also revealed Ernesto's nose to have a fracture. Bayardo stated that Ernesto would need 
be airlifted to CRMC for critical care immediately. Airlift was denied due to weather conditions.
At approximately 0115 hours, Ernesto was transported to CRMC by Sequoia Safety Council (UNIT 310). Ernesto 
was transported to CRMC code 3.

 Ernesto was 
report of a wanted felon in the area who was identified by the reporting party as Ernesto Alonzo Carrillo.

In route to assist officers, radio traffic advised that Ernesto was running southbound on the east side of Reed Ave. 
 on the ground 
and an officer had a spotlight on him and had a positively identified him. On arrival I observed Ernesto
in the prone position, with assisting officers attempting to take Ernesto into custody after a T
 deployment. I

them. Ernesto had two T

NARRATIVE
REASON FOR STOP: Call for service wanted felon.
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION: On August 19, 2023 at approximately 2149 hours, I was on routine patrol as the 
on-duty Sergeant. My uniform consisted of a Navy-blue long sleeve shirt with a “City of Reedley Police” patch and 
blue/gold chevrons on each arm. On the left breast of my shirt is a gold-colored badge and the right is a gold name 
tag and a department issued body worn camera (BWC). I was wearing a pair of clear prescription glasses. I was 
wearing a black leather duty belt, navy blue pants and black boots. I was driving Reedley PD unit 713, which has a 
traditional black and white color pattern and is fully marked with red and blue emergency lights.
Officers were dispatched to 
 
 for a reporting party stating that they were advised to 
call police if Ernesto Carrillo (9/17/86) returned to the residence. Ernesto was last seen wearing a gray shirt, blue 
jeans and a red baseball hat. I recalled being briefed at the start of my shift, which occurred around 1900 hours, that 
Ernesto had vandalized his girlfriend’s vehicle and fled prior to officers arriving. I was further advised that he had an 
active and confirmed felony warrant for PC 273.5 and PC 236, and was yet to be arrested. I recalled a specific case 
from about a month earlier where Ernesto had assaulted his girlfriend at the Edgewater Inn in Reedley. I 
remembered that incident due to the numerous times he was arrested for felony and misdemeanor domestic violence 
and for violating restraining orders. I was able to see his criminal history when I was reviewing the officers report 
from the assault at the Edgewater Inn. I could not remember the last time I had seen so many arrests for domestic 
violence by one person. I believed that Ernesto had a propensity for violence based off of his criminal history and 
based off of his habitual drug use.
Prior to responding, I called dispatch via phone and confirmed the felony warrant was active. Shortly after hanging 
up, I received a photograph of Ernesto from dispatch.
I activated my department issued BWC prior to arriving on scene. When I arrived on scene, prior to exiting my patrol 
vehicle, I heard officers advise that Ernesto had left the apartment prior to our arrival. State Center Community 
College District (SCCCD) Police Officer Serrano asked over the Reedley PD radio channel to confirm the subjects 
name of who we were looking for. Officer Serrano was advised it was Ernesto Carrillo and he stated that he had just 
contacted him in the Reedley College parking lot, for further refer to SCCCD report number 23-564.
While responding to the area Officer Serrano stated that Ernesto was in the front yard of a residence with a white 
picket fence on Reed Ave. in the area of Kip Patrick Ave. As I was driving towards that intersection, Officer Serrano 
advised that Ernesto was south of Kip Patrick Ave. on Reed Ave. I believed that Ernesto was still going to be on the 
east side of Reed Ave. when either myself or another officer would contact him. I requested an officer go to 
Riverview Ave. south of Kip Patrick Ave. in case Ernesto ran east bound from Reed Ave. I believed that Ernesto 
would run based off a prior radio transmission from Officer Cardinalle regarding Ernesto running and the severity of 
the warrant for his arrest. I wanted a perimeter set up quickly in case he fled, because I did not want him to escape. I 
feared that if he escaped, the female who was the victim of the felony assault and false imprisonment, may be at risk 
of retaliation from Ernesto if she called.

Officer Serrano asked for a Reedley Unit to drive south on Reed Ave. to contact Ernesto. When I turned southbound, 
I observed a moderate amount of traffic on the roadway. Along the roadway are streetlights that artificially light the 
area. Some areas are dimly lit and others are moderately lit. I drove approximately 50 yards and Officer Serrano 
advised me that Ernesto was to the left of my unit.
I briefly stopped and turned to contact a subject on the east sidewalk of Reed Ave. and did not recognize the subject 
from the photograph as Ernesto. Officer Serrano stated that subject I was going to contact was not Ernesto. As I 
turned and drove my unit south on Reed Ave. Officer Serrano advised he had his spotlight on Ernesto and he was 
running south bound. I observed Ernesto running southbound approximately 50 yards south of me on the east 
sidewalk of Reed Ave.. I activated my overhead emergency code 3 lights and my siren. My patrol vehicle was in the 
north and southbound lane of Reed Ave and approximately 25 yards from Ernesto. Ernesto hands were swinging 
from front to back above his waist as he was running. I observed his right hand to be empty. As his left hand was 
brought back, as he was running, his left hand had a silver somewhat reflective object protruding from his hand. At 
the time, I believed the object could possibly be a firearm or knife. While he was running Ernesto was illuminated by 
passing vehicles headlights and turning his head over his right shoulder looking in my direction.
I passed at least one, possibly two vehicles and drove almost parallel to Ernesto along the east curb of S. Reed Ave. 
As Ernesto was running, I could clearly see he was wearing baggy clothing that could easily conceal a weapon and 
he was grabbing at his left pocket. I wanted to pull nearly parallel to Ernesto because I did not want him to run into 
oncoming traffic, endangering himself and/or motorists. I had this in my mind at the time because of two separate 
body cameras I had seen in the last month of subjects being hit by oncoming traffic while fleeing police. I rolled down 
the driver side window of my patrol vehicle. My driver side mirror was approximately 3 yards behind Ernesto and 3 
yards from his right side. I unholstered and activated my department issued Conducted Energy Device (CED). I told 
Ernesto in a loud clear voice “Stop Police” but he continued running and looked over his shoulder and directly at me. 
I pointed my CED at Ernesto at some point after I rolled my driver side window down. I once again said, “Stop Police” 
in a loud clear voice and Ernesto continued running. At this point the area was dimly lit to me and I could not have a 
clear and uninterrupted view of Ernesto’s hands. I warned him ""You're gonna get tased"", and he did not stop. I 
deployed my department issued CED and Ernesto’s feet came fully of the ground and he landed on the concrete with 
his face and upper chest area.
I stopped, put my patrol vehicle in park and exited my patrol vehicle as my department issued CED was completing 
its pre-set five second cycle. Once the CED was finished cycling, Ernesto sat up and I saw a large amount of blood 
dripping from his face and covering the sidewalk. I yelled at Ernesto to show me his hands, twice, which he did not 
comply. I chose not to activate the CED again because of Ernesto’s injuries. As officers ran up to place Ernesto in 
handcuffs, I requested EMS code 3 for Ernesto before the handcuffs were fully applied to his wrists. I requested EMS 
code 3 due to Ernesto’s injuries to his head. Ernesto was making groaning noises, which I believed to be from pain 
he was feeling. Within minutes Ernesto was talking to officers about the handcuffs being tight. During a search of 
Ernesto, I observed officer Nava remove an object from Ernesto’s left pocket or waistband area. The object had a 
black handle approximately four inches long and a silver piece of metal that protrude from the tool. When the object 
was removed, I initially thought it was a “Zip gun”. A zip gun is a personally manufactured firearm from common 
items. I then realized it was a “window punch”, which is a tool used to break car windows. I believe this item may 
have been what Ernesto was running with but can not be certain, as I did not have a view of his left hand during the 
entire contact.
I was also advised that Ernesto had a knife on him. I advised officers to place Ernesto on his side, to prevent him 
from aspirating blood from the facial trauma. Ernesto sat up and I believed allowing him to be in a position of comfort 
would be most beneficial for him. I did instruct officers not to allow him to lay on his back. I was able to see that one 
probe from the CED struck Ernesto on the back of his upper neck and the other on the right side of his lower back. 
During the call I photograph Ernesto and provided them to Officer Renteria to be attached to this report.

Shortly after the use of force, I wanted to check again if the caller was the female related to the warrant because I 
worried that she may have been injured and dispatch advised me it was different caller. Dispatch advised the caller 
was related to a prior vandalism call.
I asked Officer Cardinalle to conduct a neighborhood canvass for surveillance and witnesses to the incident. Ernesto 
was transported to Adventist Health. I was later advised by Officer Cardinalle that Ernesto suffered severe injuries 
from the fall and was going to be transported to Community Regional Medical Center (CRMC) for surgery. I 
contacted Commander Ediger and advised him of the case.
Ernesto was transported to CRMC and is currently listed in critical but stable condition.

NARRATIVE
SUPEMENTAL REPORT:
On 08/18/2023 at approximately 2149 hours during uniform patrol and driving a marked patrol vehicle, I assisted 
Officer Renteria on a unwanted subject call for service. The location provided for 
 
 Reedley 
PD dispatch advised the subject's name is Ernesto Carrillo and he had an active Felony warrant.
I worked the night before and was aware of Ernesto's warrant. The night before Ernesto was involved in a vandalism 
(for further information regarding the vandalism see case number 23-2741). I have had prior contacts with Ernesto 
for felony domestic violence.
I advised assisting officers over the radio that he had priors for felony domestic violence.
I arrived on scene and started a perimeter at the apartments to the north.
Assisting officers arrived on scene to contact Ernesto. Officer Renteria advised over the radio that the reporting party 
(RP) stated Ernesto left the scene. Officer Renteria advised he was last seen wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans.
Officer Serrano from State Center Community College District (SCCCD) advised over the radio that a male matching 
the description was on Reed Ave walking southbound. Officer Serrano stated over the radio that it was Ernesto, and 
he was now running southbound Reed Ave.
I drove southbound in the 1200 block N. Reed Ave east alleyway in case Ernesto ran eastbound.
Sgt. Puryear advised over the radio that he was contacted Ernesto and he was actively running. Shortly after Sgt. 
Puryear asked for EMS to respond with lights and sirens.
I arrived on scene and observed Officer Renteria standing by Ernesto while Ernesto was handcuffed and sitting on 
the curb. I walked up with my medical bag and notice Ernesto was bleeding from his nose. I did not want to make it 
difficult for Ernesto to breath so I tried to keep him leaned forward so he would not choke from his blood.
Ernesto kept trying to get up so I told him multiple times to stay seated. He would move around so I tried to keep him 
still to avoid any further injuries.
Officer Renteria stood by Ernesto so I could stay available for any other calls for service.

 comment about S01 Ruelas not wanting to give away

2 A Sheriff's Office Quick Response Team (QRF) was established, which
3 consisted of Deputy

4 Bunal, Deputy Amaya, Niner, and me. Deputy Contreras was equipped
5 with a 40mm less lethal munition, Deputy Amaya and Deputy Ashley were
6 equipped with a ballistic shield, Deputy

7 AR15 rifle, and I had my K9 partner Niner with me.

9 Prior to searching the residences, Deputy Amaya and Deputy Contreras
10 verbally contacted S01 Ruelas and gave him the opportunity to

3 S01 Ruelas was given a reasonable amount of time to deescalate and
4 surrender to law enforcement. S01 Ruelas failed to obey our commands.
5

7 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF K9:
8
9 Based on the information I developed on the scene, I determined S01
10 Ruelas was wanted for a felony warrant involving a firearm, had a
11 prior history of assault with a deadly weapon, a gun, and resisting
12 arrest. 
13
14 Because S01 Ruelas was hiding in an unknown area, had access to
15 unconventional weapons, was given multiple warnings to surrender
16 peacefully, and was resisting arrest, I believed that S01 Ruelas
17 posed an immediate threat to deputies on the scene and the public.
18
19 Based on the facts mentioned above, I determined that the use of K9
20 Niner was within policy, and the use of K9 Niner would enhance
21 officer safety significantly, increase the likelihood of locating and
22 apprehension of the suspect. The use of K9 Niner would bring this
23 incident to a quick resolution without endangering the public or
24 searching deputies.
25
26 SCENE DESCRIPTION:
27
28 The area to be searched was a single-family home that was currently
29 being renovated and had a detached garage that had been converted

5 USE OF FORCE/USE OF K9 NINER:
6
7 Our QRF team began our search of the property at the driveway's
8 entrance. I conducted my search off-leash. 
9
10 The QRF team searched and cleared the detached garage that had three
11 bedrooms inside. We used a breaching ram to break down an inner
12 connecting door. We did not locate S01 Ruelas inside this structure.
13
14
15 We moved to the main structure and attempted to open the door with the
16 keys R01 
 provided us. None of the keys provided to us worked to
17 open the door. We had to use a breaching ram again to access the main
18 house. Once the door was breached, I gave K9 Niner his search
19 command. 
20
21 K9 Niner made entry into the house through the kitchen door and began
22 to search. In this portion of the house, it had a continuous open
23 flow. The house was under construction with power tools, handheld
24 tools, household items that could be used as unconventional tools
25 that could cause harm to searching deputies. 
26
27 As K9 Niner was searching west of the kitchen, which appeared to be a
28 possible living room, he had a behavior change. Niner was smelling
29 the floorboards and was pacing back and forth. When I attempted to
30 have K9 Niner leave this portion of the structure, he did not want to

1 leave. Niner would leave and immediately go back. I informed the team
2 that K9 Niner showed a change and S01 Ruelas could be under the
3 residence. We continued our search of the residence and did not
4 locate S01 Ruelas inside.
5
6 The QRF team exited the west sliding glass door and searched the
7 remaining part of the backyard. There were multiple tool sheds,
8 gardening tools, and other unconventional weapons that could be
9 weaponized to hurt searching deputies and K9 Niner. We searched the
10 entry backyard and did not locate S01 Ruelas.
11
12 We returned to the area where K9 Niner initially showed a behavior
13 change. Once we returned to this portion of the house, K9 Niner
14 immediately began to search. There was a hole in the floorboard where
15 K9 Niner put his nose in. Niner took a deep breath and immediately
16 began to dig into the floorboard with his front paws. I told the QRF
17 team that S01 Ruelas was underneath the house. 
18
19 We began to look for an entry point near where K9 Niner was searching
20 for S01 Ruelas. We could not locate an entry point but advised
21 Sergeant Tracey that we believed S01 Ruelas was under the house.
22 Sergeant Tracey spoke with R01 
, who advised there was a crawl
23 space door in the house's bathroom.
24
25 We went to the bathroom and located the plywood that was on the floor.
26 It should be noted that the plywood in the bathroom did not appear to
27 be disturbed. A sitting stool was on top of the wood, which appeared
28 to be flush with all the other boards. I attempted to move one of the
29 plywood boards on the bathroom's east wall. In the left corner, a
30 metal pole made it difficult to lift. I had to move the pole to

1 remove the board.
2
3 After I removed the plywood board, there was another piece of plywood.
4 To remove this piece of wood, I had to pull it towards me because the
5 wood was tucked under the sheetrock. I would not have been able to
6 remove the plywood without pulling it toward me.
7
8 It should be noted that there was no way for S01 Ruelas to have been
9 able to go underneath both pieces of wood without the assistance of
10 someone else. I believe S01 Ruelas had help getting underneath the
11 floor to the crawl space from an unknown person on the property. The
12 only other people on the property were 
 and 
. 
13
14 Once the crawl space was exposed, I gave additional K9 announcements
15 to S01 Ruelas. I said, ""Marcus, this is your last and final warning,
16 bud. I'm going to send my dog down there, and you will be bit."" I did
17 not hear, see, or get a response from S01 Ruelas. Based on S01
18 Ruelas’ location, it was not feasible to use any other means of
19 lesser force to effect the arrest. Based on the confined space and
20 distance, OC spray would not have been effective. Any impact weapon
21 or hands on restraint would not have been feasible for safe for
22 deputies, as they would have to enter a confined crawl space.
23 Finally, the use of less lethal munition would not have been possible
24 given the fact we did not know S01 Ruelas’ exact location.

26 It was for these reasons above, K9 Niner was the only force option
27 available to deputies in order to overcome S01 Ruelas’ resistance and
28 affect the arrest. I advised County Communications that we would give
29 several more use of force warnings and K9 announcements at the crawl
30 space to have S01 Ruelas surrender peacefully. I said the

9 After a reasonable time was given to S01 Ruelas for surrender, he
10 failed to comply with our orders. I did not hear, see, or get a
11 response from S01 Ruelas or anyone underneath the crawl space. I
12 advised County Communications that we did not get a response and
13 would be deploying K9 Niner into the crawl space.
14
15 I gave K9 Niner his search/apprehension command.
16
17 Deputy Amaya, who was in the kitchen on the south end of the house,
18 asked if K9 Niner was underneath the house. I told him yes. Shortly
19 after, Deputy Amaya advised that K9 Niner located S01 Ruelas and was
20 biting him. I gave K9 Niner his bite command and advised County
21 Communications.
22
23 I walked to Deputy Amaya's location in the kitchen and could hear S01
24 Ruelas screaming. I told S01 Ruelas to stop fighting the dog and to
25 bring him to me. I immediately told the QRF team to start looking for
26 an entry point to where we heard S01 Ruelas screaming.
27
28 I walked back to the south end of the house at the entrance to the
29 crawl space and attempted to call K9 Niner back to my location. I
30 made several attempts but was unable to get K9 Niner back to my

1 location. I returned to the kitchen area and told S01 Ruelas to stop
2 fighting the dog. I could hear S01 Ruelas screaming.
3
4 At some point, S01 Ruelas stopped screaming. I could no longer hear
5 any movement coming from under the house. Because S01 Ruelas had
6 prior weapons charges and the multiple knives/unconventional weapons
7 observed inside the residence and additional unconventional weapons;
8 I believed that S01 Ruelas may have stabbed K9 Niner or choked him
9 until he was unconscious. 
10
11 I immediately went back to the crawl space and called for K9 Niner. I
12 could not hear S01 Ruelas screaming or any movement from both S01
13 Ruelas and K9 Niner. Approximately a minute later, I heard S01 Ruelas
14 start screaming again. I contacted County Communications and
15 immediately requested SJFD to respond to our location with a
16 chainsaw. The QRF team continued to attempt to make a hole in the
17 floor to gain access to S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner.  
18
19 Since I could not gain compliance from S01 Ruelas to come to me nor I
20 could not see or get K9 Niner back to my location, Deputy Ashley and
21 I decided to go under the crawl space to get a visual on S01 Ruelas
22 and K9 Niner. Because the crawl space was small, Deputy Ashley and I
23 removed our Sheriff's Office tactical vests. We removed our vest to
24 have a better chance of moving underneath the house.
25
26 It should be mentioned that there was about a one-and-a-half to two
27 feet clearance underneath the house and ground. There was both dry
28 dirt and mud that was underneath the house. The crawl space was dark
29 and had little to no ambient light. There were wood beams, nails,
30 metal pipes, and other hazards that made it difficult to maneuver

1 underneath the house. Deputy Ashley and I had to do an army low crawl
2 on our stomachs to move to S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner.
3
4 As I low crawled to S01 Ruelas' and Niner's location, it was hard to
5 distinguish exactly how far they were. As I closed the distance to K9
6 Niner and S01 Ruelas, there were several times when my duty belt or
7 uniform got stuck on a pipe, wire, or nail. These obstacles made it
8 very difficult for me to move rapidly.
9
10 Using my flashlight, I was able to illuminate S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner.
11 I could see that K9 Niner was biting S01 Ruelas's left forearm. S01
12 Ruelas was lying on his left hip. S01 Ruelas was using his right hand
13 to grab the neck area of K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas was using his right
14 hand to choke K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas continued to fight K9 Niner. He
15 moved his right hand from the neck area and placed it on the bridge
16 of K9 Niner's nose. S01 Ruelas used his right hand to push K9 Niner's
17 face into the mud. It appeared as if S01 Ruelas was trying to
18 suffocate K9 Niner in the mud.
19
20 At this time, I was about fifteen to twenty feet away from S01 Ruelas
21 and K9 Niner. I gave K9 Niner his release command, and K9 Niner
22 immediately released S01 Ruelas' left forearm. I recalled Niner to my
23 location, but as K9 Niner was starting to come, S01 Ruelas used both
24 hands to strike K9 Niner in the face.  
25
26 K9 Niner immediately re-engaged and re-bit S01 Ruelas' left forearm.
27 Before moving up to K9 Niner's and S01 Ruelas' locations, I told
28 Deputy Ashley to maintain visual on S01 Ruelas because he had not
29 been searched.

1 Based on the fact that S01 Ruelas continued to pose a threat to K9
2 Niner by fighting him, I crawled to K9 Niner and S01 Ruelas'
3 location. I took ahold of K9 Niner's collar and gave him his release
4 command. Niner released S01 Ruelas' left forearm, and we immediately
5 crawled away from S01 Ruelas.
6
7 Deputy Ashley retreated a couple of feet and was able to keep an eye
8 on S01 Ruelas. Deputy Ashley provided the deputies on the ground
9 floor with updates on S01 Ruelas' condition.
10
11 It should be noted that from the south end of the crawl space
12 entry/exit to where S01 Ruelas was located on the north end of the
13 crawl space was approximately 75-80 feet in length.
14
15 I immediately crawled back to the entry/exit point of the crawl space.
16 I was able to exit the crawl space with K9 Niner. Once we were out of
17 the crawl space, I saw that K9 Niner was extremely tired and having
18 difficulty breathing. K9 Niner's tongue was fully extended out of his
19 mouth and was hanging to the left/right side of his mouth, causing K9
20 Niner to gasp for air. I immediately went to my patrol vehicle and
21 advised County Communications that I was driving code three to the

2 During K9 Niner’s initial exam 
 medical staff observed that he had
3 an elevated temperature, had some mild asymmetry of his pupils, had
4 some blood vessels that were broke in his eyes, and had blood come
5 from his nose. K9 Niner’s penis was also exposed, and Dr. 
 had to
6 put it back inside the external foreskin. 
7
8 Doctor 
 advised that they needed to have x-rays done on K9 Niner.
9 After the x-rays were completed, Dr. 
 told me that K9 Niner had
10 some swelling around his neck. Dr. 
 told me that all K9 Niner’s
11 injuries he suffered were consent with a dog that has been choked. 
12
13 K9 Niner was prescribed pain medication (gabapentin and Meloxicam).
14 Dr. 
 advised that K9 Niner take a week off from work and rest. She
15 advised that he needed to have minimum movement and needed rest to

8 On 08/16/2023 at approximately 1751 hours, Sergeant Monroe responded
9 to 
 Meadow Lane, located in San Jose, with his police service
10 dog, “Niner”, to assist in locating S-1 Marcus Ruelas at this
11 address.  Refer to Sergeant Monroe’s supplemental report for further
12 details about his deployment with Niner.  Also refer to Deputy
13 Bunal’s original report for further details about his investigation
14 and the warrant for S-1 Marcus’ arrest.
15
16 At approximately 1950 hours, Sergeant Monroe informed Dispatch that he
17 was responding to the 
 Veterinary Center, 
18
 in order to provide Niner immediate medical
19 attention.  
 Veterinary Center is a 24-hours emergency medical
20 center for animals.  Sergeant Monroe responded to the 
 Veterinary
21 Center with his red lights and siren activated to his patrol car. 
22
23 Based on Sergeant Monroe’s statement about him responding to the 
24 Veterinary Center to provide Niner immediate medical attention and
25 was responding with an emergency response, I also responded to
26 assist.  Upon my arrival, I saw Sergeant Monroe and Niner inside the
27 emergency center.  Sergeant Monroe was wearing a Sheriff’s Office
28 uniform.  I noticed that Sergeant Monroe and his uniform were covered
29 in mud.  I also noticed that Niner was covered in mud.

1 While at the medical center, I learned that S-1 Marcus intentionally
2 assaulted Niner while Niner was physically apprehending him in the
3 crawlspace of the residence.  Refer to Sergeant Monroe’s supplemental
4 report for further details about the physical apprehension and S-1
5 Marcus assaulting Niner.  
6
7 Deputy Edwards also responded to the 
 Medical Center to assist.  I
8 provided my department cell phone to Deputy Edwards so he could take
9 digital photographs of Sergeant Monroe and Niner.  Sergeant Monroe
10 was still wearing his Sheriff’s Office uniform when Deputy Edwards
11 took photographs of him and Niner.  Deputy Edwards provided me the
12 department cell phone back after he took the photographs of Sergeant
13 Monroe and Niner.    
14
15 S-1 Marcus was transported to San Jose Regional Medical Center so he
16 could receive further medical attention for the injuries he sustained
17 from the physical apprehension.  I drove to San Jose Regional Medical
18 Center, located in San Jose, to assist Deputy Fisher who was already
19 on scene.
20
21 Upon my arrival at the hospital, I met with Deputy Fisher and
22 Lieutenant Moore who were standing by with S-1 Marcus.  S-1 Marcus
23 was in room #23 and being treated for his injuries.  S-1 Marcus’
24 clothing appeared to be intentionally cut so the hospital staff could
25 provide him medical attention.  S-1 Marcus and his clothing were also
26 covered in mud.  I saw S-1 Marcus’ left arm wrapped in gauze.  I also
27 saw fresh abrasions, puncture wounds, and lacerations to S-1 Marcus’
28 left leg which were consistent to a dog bite.

19 appeared to be approximately 6 to 8 inches in length while the other
20 laceration, that had three sutures, appeared to be approximately 2 to
21  3 inches in length.  
22
23 I looked at S-1 Marcus’ right arm and bicep.  S-1 Marcus had one

SUMMARY: 
5 
 
6 
Suspect, EDWIN QUINTANILLA, was taken into custody by the Seaside Police 
7 
Department.  QUINTANILLA sustained injury from a CHP K9 dog bite to the right 
8 
side of his face and a deployment from my department issued CEW probes to 
9 
the left side portion of his body.  QUINTANILLA was transported to Natividad 
10 
Medical Center via AMR for treatment. 
11 
 
12 
This supplemental report outlines my involvement in this case regarding the use 
13 
of my department issued CEW on QUINTANILLA.

INVESTIGATION: 
22 
 
23 
On 8/8/2023 at approximately 1050 hours, I was at an unrelated detail at Del 
24 
Monte and Camino El Estero. I overheard a radio call for mutual aid request in 
25 
the 1500 block of Fremont in Seaside. MPD officers SABINO and Lt. ANDREWS 
26 
responded from the city of Monterey.  
27 
 
28 
I was in full uniform wearing my Axon BWC and driving a Monterey Police 
29 
Marked Patrol Vehicle 53.  I started to drive towards the location and heard an 
30 
update the suspect vehicle was a black BMW which stopped in the middle of a 
31 
busy intersection within Seaside.  
32 
 
33 
As I started to drive towards the City of Seaside, I overheard police officers were 
34 
attempting a high-risk stop of the occupants. I heard over the radio one of the 
35 
subjects from the vehicle stopped had motioned or imitated they had a firearm at 
36 
one of the officers. Further updates on the radio were one of the occupants was 
37 
refusing to exit the vehicle and was not cooperating with police verbal commands 
38 
during the high-risk stop. 
39 
 
40 
For further information, reference Seaside Case No. EG2301716.   
41 
 
42 
As I arrived at scene, I met with Seaside Police OFFICER CRIVELLO and other 
43 
Seaside Police Officers who were trying to communicate with QUINTANILLA in 
44 
the passenger seat of the vehicle.

While at the scene, Officers tried numerous communications with QUINTANILLA 
47 
via PA. These commands to gain compliance were spoken in English and 
48 
Spanish.   
49 
 
50 
The driver had already been detained by the Seaside Police Department and 
51 
was tentatively identified verbally as DOUGLAS GARCIA. 
52 
 
53 
QUINTANILLA was sitting in the front passenger seat and was playing music 
54 
loudly from the vehicle and revving the vehicles engine while sitting in the 
55 
passenger seat. QUNTILLA-GARCIA was ignoring all commands and 
56 
communication with officers.  Both the driver and passenger window were rolled 
57 
down completely. 
58 
 
59 
CHP K9 OFFICER JACOBS and his K9 RUDY arrived at scene for a K9 
60 
deployment. 
61 
 
62 
CHP OFFICER JACOBS deployed K9 RUDY after numerous attempts to gain 
63 
compliance, communication, and announcement of the K9 presence/deployment. 
64 
K9 RUDY jumped through the passenger side of the vehicle. K9 RUDY bit 
65 
QUINTANILLA on the right side of his face.  Officers started to converge towards 
66 
the dog, as QUINTANILLA was struggling and resisting the K9.  
67 
 
68 
For further information refer to CHP report F-02088-701-23. 
69 
 
70 
I was tasked by Seaside PD OFFICER CRIVELLO to utilize my CEW in case 
71 
QUINTANILLA was not compliant during the officers' approach for arrest. 
72 
 
73 
As officers approached the passenger side of the vehicle MPD Officer SABINO 
74 
and SSPD officer CRIVELLO tried to pull QUINTILLA_GARCIA out of the 
75 
passenger seat by grabbing his left wrist. I went around towards the driver's side 
76 
door where the window was still down.  I could see QUINTANILLA was struggling 
77 
with the K-9 and officers as they were trying to remove him from the passenger 
78 
seat of the vehicle. MPD Officer SABINO and SSPD officers tried to pull 
79 
QUUINTILLA-GARCIA out of the car, however QUINTANILLA was resisting.  For 
80 
further information, refer to MPD officer SABINO supplemental report. 
81 
 
82 
I saw QUINTANILLA was moving his arms around, and pulling away from officers 
83 
making it difficult for officers to affect an arrest.  At one point, I observed 
84 
QUINTANILLA'S hands where I could see there was no immediate weapon in his 
85 
hands.

Based on QUINTANILLA'S violent resistive behavior, not listening or complying 
105 
to simple commands, the potential threat of a firearm on QUINTANILLA person 
106 
or inside the vehicle, and the fact he was under arrest, I deployed my 
107 
department-issued Taser 7 CEW, Serial No. X4000MM4X. 
108 
 
109 
I gave a verbal command the Taser was going to be deployed. I shot my CEW at 
110 
QUINTANILLA, striking him on the left side of his body (flank).  I noticed the 
111 
spread was approximately 8 to 14 inches in width of his body, and the CEW was 
112 
effective.   
113 
 
114 
QUINTANILLA was pulled out of the vehicle onto the ground.  QUINTANILLA 
115 
continued to resist officers during the CEW deployment.  My deployment of the 
116 
CEW was for one-5 second cycle.  During the 5-second cycle, I disengaged the 
117 
cycle where the CEW deployment lasted 4 seconds.  
118 
 
119 
QUINTANILLA was placed in a WRAP, and spit hood was placed over 
120 
QUINTANILLA based on his restive behavior, and biohazard fluids from the injury 
121 
he sustained from K9 RUDY bite. QUINTANILLA was given medical aid by 
122 
officers at scene and eventually taken by AMR personnel to Natividad Medical 
123 
Center. 
124 
 
125 
I saw that the two probes that were in QUINTANILLA'S left side of his body were 
126 
on the ground. There was also an approximate 8-10 inch screwdriver laying on 
127 
the ground which came from QUINTANILLA’s person. The screwdriver was 
128 
photographed and collected by Seaside officers. 
129 
 
130 
I took photographs collecting the probes and booked them into evidence at MPD.   
131

SUMMARY: 
5 
 
6 
This supplemental report documents my involvement with the arrest of EDWIN 
7 
ANTONIO GARCIA QUINTANILLA during a high risk traffic stop in the city of 
8 
Seaside.

INVESTIGATION: 
11 
 
12 
On 08/08/2023 I was assigned to the Community Action Team (CAT). I was 
13 
wearing full marked Monterey uniform with a department issued body worn 
14 
camera. The body cam was activated during the investigation.  
15 
 
16 
At approximately 1050 hours, Dispatched advised a black BMW with a partial 
17 
plate of 8 had motioned a handgun at a Seaside Officer. The vehicle’s license 
18 
plate had black spray paint in the corners and was last seen southbound on 
19 
Fremont towards the city of Monterey.  
20 
 
21 
I was doubled with LIEUTENANT ANDREWS in PD 56 and we responded to 
22 
assist in locating the suspect vehicle possibly on its way to our jurisdiction.  
23 
 
24 
A Seaside Officer advised dispatch they were behind the vehicle in the area of 
25 
Canyon Del Rey and Fremont. The vehicle stopped near the intersection of 
26 
Fremont Blvd and Sonoma. Seaside Officers began a high risk traffic stop on the 
27 
suspect vehicle.  
28 
 
29 
Seaside Police asked for mutual aid assistance and LIEUTENANT ANDREWS 
30 
and I were tasked with blocking traffic at Sonoma and Terrace.  
31 
 
32 
Once we were relived from our traffic control position, LIEUTENANT ANDREWS 
33 
and I responded to the high risk stop. The passenger was not listening to 
34 
commands and was refusing to exit the vehicle. The suspect was identified as 
35 
EDWIN ANTONIO GARCIA QUINTANILLA. For more information, refer to 
36 
Seaside case EG2301716. 
37 
 
38 
Two California Highway Patrol K-9 units responded to the traffic stop.  
39 
 
40 
I was asked by a Seaside Officer to deploy a ballistic shield and assist with the 
41 
arrest team. A CHP K-9 OFFICER deployed his dog into the open passenger 
42 
window. Once the dog was deployed, myself and other Seaside Officers 
43 
approached the passenger door to take QUINTANILLA into custody.

QUINTANILLA did not want to exit the vehicle and he had to be pulled out of the 
46 
car by his hands.  QUINTANILLA kept pulling his hands away from Officers grip.  
47 
 
48 
At one point, I held on to QUINTANILLA left arm and tried pulling him out of the 
49 
vehicle. As I was holding QUINTANILLA arm, OFFICER VENTIMIGILA deployed 
50 
his CEW device. For more information, refer to OFFICER VENTIMIGLIA original 
51 
narrative.  
52 
 
53 
I assisted pulling QUINTANILLA out of the vehicle and grabbed on to his left wrist 
54 
until it was handcuffed by another officer.  
55 
 
56 
QUINTANILLA continued resisting Officers after he was handcuffed. Seaside 
57 
Offices requested to deploy a body wrap. Lt. Andrews and I assisted with placing 
58 
the lower body portion of the body wrap on QUINTANILLA’s ankles and knees. 
59 
At the request of Seaside Officers, I placed a spit mask over the mouth of 
60 
QUINTANILLA.  
61 
 
62 
This ends my involvement in this case.

Report # 23-011553 - Offense/Incident Report Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office Pg 3 of 11

 

Inmates that are in-custody at SRJ sometimes need to be transported to various hospitals out of SRJ
for various medical reasons which require the presence of deputies to provide security to ensure the
inmate does not escape custody.

JGP has several assigned staff members working within several units of the hospital and are assigned
different duties such as psychiatric doctors, registered nurses, mental health professionals, and
security guards.

While seated in the A unit of JGP, | was assigned to one side of the unit with Depuy M. Souza-Pellow.
Deputy Souza-Pellow and | were monitoring our assigned inmate while Deputies M. Claure and G.
Rodriguez, were also assigned to the other side of A unit providing security for their assigned inmate.

| noticed that several JGP staff members were escorting a black male adult who was admitted to the
hospital as a patient and later identified as | noticed that as the staff and

walked out of a nearby recreation room, made a right turn out of the room and began to walk
straight towards Deputies Claure. Deputy Claure was seated on chair and in a position where she was
able to view walking up to her. | had a direct line of sight of where Deputy Claure was seated
and noticed that continued walking towards Deputy Claure.

 
  
 

Suddenly, and without provocation, | saw i quickly advance towards Deputy Claure and he was
followed by several staff members chasing after him. violently collided into Deputy Claure and
he assaulted her by grabbing her head. | quickly ran over to assist Deputy Claure and to try and
restrain a from attacking her further. | observed Deputy Rodriguez quickly react and intervene
as he stood up and grabbed ahold of J from behind to stop JJ assault to Deputy Claure.

 

| saw Deputy Rodriguez quickly take [J to the ground where [ij fell onto his stomach in the
prone position. | assisted Deputy Rodriguez by positioning myself on the right side of body
and placed both of my hands on right arm. | gave several verbal orders to place his
hands behind his back. | could feel resist my attempts to control him by tensing his arms and
stiffening his muscles which | perceived was an attempt by him to try and prevent me from
establishing control of his arm. | used more strength to try and force right arm behind him,
but he continued to refuse to comply. | was unable to de-escalate due to the immediacy at
which the assault occurred. After giving several more verbal commands to place his hands
behind his back, my force was effective, and eventually complied. Deputy Rodriguez and |
were able to place hands behind him close together. Deputy Claure detained J in
handcuffs without further incident.

 

   
  

 
  

   

 

After was detained in handcuffs, | ensured that Deputy Rodriguez and | were aware of
being in the prone position and that he needed to be brought to the recovery position, so his

breathing was not restricted. Deputy Rodriguez and | sat [J upright and positioned him in the
seated position against a door.

| noticed that Deputy Rodriguez appeared injured as he advised me that he had pain to his right pinky
finger. Deputy Claure was not on scene after the incident took place and a nurse nearby advised that
she had been taken to a nearby area where she was examined by onsite medical staff for several
injuries she had sustained.

Shortly after, I broadcasted via my handheld radio about the incident that had just occurred and 
requested emergency medical personnel along with a sergeant to respond to the scene.
Sergeant R. Swetavage responded to the scene into A unit moments after.
Several JGP staff members were in the area during the incident however, only one was able to 
provide a statement about what occurred and what he witnessed. I spoke with 
 
 who is 
assigned to JGP as a mental health professional who attends to patients and provides security for 
staff members. 
 provided me with the following summarized video statement which was 
captured via my temporary issued BWC.

). 
 acknowledged, and escorted 
 back to his room.

 said he 
could walk to his room on his own and did not need any assistance. As 
 walked out of the 
television room, he made an immediate right turn and began walking towards the area where Deputy 
Claure and Deputy Rodriguez were seated.
 said that after 
 turned to walk towards the deputies, he figured something was wrong 
and suspected that 
 was not going to listen.

 video statement.
I assessed 
 for any injuries he may have sustained and noticed he had blood coming from his 
lower lip. 
 also complained of pain to his chest but stated it was from an unrelated incident that 
had occurred prior.
I took several digital photographs of 
 injuries and of the locations of his right arm where I 
used force. I spoke with Deputies Rodriguez and Claure after the incident had occurred and they 
advised me of the locations of where they used force on 
 to overcome his resistance and 
detain him in handcuffs. Deputy Claure advised that she only used force on 
 after he attacked 
her by placing his legs into a figure-four leg lock. Deputy Rodriguez advised that he used force on 
 by grabbing him from behind and taking him to the ground. Deputy Rodriguez also stated that 
he controlled 
 left arm so it could be placed into handcuffs. Refer to Deputies Claure and 
Rodriguez’ supplemental reports.
Several digital photographs of 
 overall condition were taken to document where deputies 
used force on his body. I took several digital photographs of 
 legs, both of his arms, his back, 
shoulders, and head. I also took photographs of 
 lip where he was bleeding.

I also took several digital photographs of the area of where the attack occurred which showed the 
desk and chairs Deputies Claure and Rodriguez had been seated in were in disarray.
Additional photographs of Deputies Claure and Rodriguez were taken to document their overall 
condition and injuries they suffered. All of the photographs taken during this incident were later 
uploaded to a secured server.
Per JGP staff, they advised me that 
 was not able to be discharged from JGP care as he 
needed to be evaluated by a psychiatric doctor on site for his mental health condition which he had 
originally been brought into their care for.
Deputies Claure and Rodriguez were transported to the Standford Tri-Valley Medical Center located at 
5555 W. Las Positas Boulevard in Pleasanton to be assessed for their injuries. Both were escorted by 
Sergeant R. Romeril.
Based on 
 actions and violent assault on Deputy Claure, along with preventing her from 
performing her duties by means of force and violence while she was providing security of the inmate 
admitted to JGP, he was in violation of PC 243(B) – Battery on a peace officer. 
 was also in 
violation of PC 69(a) – Every person who attempts, by means of violence to deter an officer from the 
performance of their duties.
Due to the totality of circumstances and for witnessing 
 assault and battery on Deputy 
Claure, I placed him under arrest for the above listed violations. Due to 
 being in the care of 
JGP, 
 remained there on a police hold and he would be released to the custody of deputies to 
be transported to SRJ where he would be booked into custody.
A record check revealed that 
 was currently on California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation (CDCR) parole for PC 459 – Burglary. I contacted CDCR parole and requested for 
 parole to be revoked. CDCR authorized and issued a parole hold for 
 pursuant to PC 
3056 – Parole violation. See attached parole hold abstract.
Further record check revealed that since 2019, 
 had been involved in several assaults on 
deputies within SRJ including PC 243(B) and PC 148(a) (1) – Resisting, obstructing, and delaying a 
peace officer.
After Deputies Rodriguez and Claure returned from the hospital, I observed Deputy Rodriguez with a 
splint around his right pinky finger and he had pain to his right wrist. Deputy Claure had sustained a 
small laceration under her left eye along with a contusion on her forehead. Deputy Claure also had 
pain to her right knee and right elbow.
Deputies Claure and Rodriguez both advised me that they perceived 
 assault as intentional 
and specifically meant to cause her physical harm.
Based on Deputy Rodriguez sustaining a dislocated pinky finger as a result of 
 resistive 
behavior and assault on Deputy Claure, he was also in violation of PC 148.10(a) – Every person who 
willfully resists a peace officer which causes the peace officer serious bodily injury.

For the past several months, there have been multiple ""Be on the Lookout"" (BOL's) in patrol briefings
for Cesar Rios being wanted for a numerous crimes. These crimes included 236 PC, 166(c)(1) PC,
3455 PC, 243(e)(1) PC, 594(b)(1) PC, and 459 PC. Attached to these BOL's was also a DMV
photograph of Rios. Throughout this time, | have conducted a records check of Rios through the
Salinas Police Department Records Division which revealed he is a registered Sureno gang member
and has an extensive violent criminal history to include robbery, brandishing a weapon, possession of
a loaded firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, battery on a peace officer, threatening a peace
officer, and others. As of 7/27/2023 | again conducted a records check of Rios which revealed he had
one active felony warrant and three misdemeanor warrants for his arrest and was currently on PRCS.
The felony warrant was for 236 PC - False Imprisonment.

On 7/26/2023 at approximately 2212 hours, | was on duty as a Salinas Police Officer assigned to the
K9 unit with my police service dog K9 Tyson. | was in full uniform and driving a fully-marked Salinas
Police Department patrol vehicle.

While patrolling in the area of N. Main St. and E. Alvin Dr. | observed a black 2017 Chevrolet Malibu
with CA license plate IJ. Based on the research | have done of Rios, | recognized this vehicle
to be associated to him and belonged to his girlfriend IEEE. | observed the vehicle pulling
into the Dollar Tree parking lot which is located at 1441 N. Main St. Due to there being numerous
street lights in the parking lot, it was a well lit area therefore, | was able to see into the rear window of
the vehicle and observed an individual with a pony tail in the backseat. Based on my knowledge and
photographs of Rios, | know that he had a pony tail. Based on the fact that this vehicle belonged to
and my knowledge of Rios continuously violating the criminal protective order, | believed Rios
was possibly the individual in the backseat. | advised County Communications and requested several
units to my location in order to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle. | followed the vehicle to the area
of W. Laurel Dr. and Parkside Dr. where | observed the vehicle fail to stop behind the limit line at this
stop sign before turning westbound.

  

As the vehicle turned onto W. Laurel Dr., it continued towards Monroe St. where it made a southbound
turn. At this point, several other units arrived at my location and | activated my emergency lights and
siren, to include one stale red light facing forward and conducted a traffic stop. The vehicle slowly
continued southbound until the reached the apartment complex located at 1185 Monroe St. where it
came to a complete stop in the middle of the roadway. | immediately exited my patrol vehicle and
ordered for the vehicle to be turned off. The rear right passenger door then opened and | observed
Rios exit the vehicle and immediately ran on Monroe St. towards the apartment complex. | gave a
canine announcement warning Rios that he was going to be bit by the dog however he continued to
run southbound. At this moment, | opened the rear door to my patrol vehicle and made the decision to
deploy K9 Tyson based on the following facts known to me at the time.

Rios was a fleeing felony suspect who had a felony arrest warrant for 236 PC - False Imprisonment
and three misdemeanor warrants for 166(c)(1) PC and 594(b)(1) PC. Based on my knowledge of Rios,
| Know he has an extensive violent criminal history to include being in possession of a loaded firearm
and assaulting peace officers. Rios is also a registered Sureno gang member and based on my
training and experience, | Know gang members are often times in possession of firearms or other
deadly weapons that can be used against pursuing officers. Rios was unsearched and was wearing
baggy clothing in which he could have easily concealed a firearm or deadly weapon. Rios was also

running towards an apartment complex and due to the time of day, | feared if he was not immediately
apprehended by the K9 he would have the opportunity to force his way into a residence to further his
escape and possibly create a hostage situation. | also feared if he was able to successfully run into
the apartment complex, he would be able to conceal himself putting pursuing officers at a tactical point
of disadvantage.

My decision to deploy K9 Tyson was not made with any intention of causing Rios serious injury but
rather as a tool to quickly apprehend him while minimizing the danger to the public, officers, and Rios
himself.

As | opened the rear door, | gave chase after Rios and gave K9 Tyson the heel command. | then gave
K9 Tyson the apprehension command and he chased after Rios and apprehended him on the inner
left thigh. | ran up to Rios grabbed his left arm and pulled him onto the ground. | ordered him to put his
hands behind his back and he did so as | was holding onto his left wrist. At this point, other officers
arrived on scene and assisted me with putting Rios into handcuffs. Once Rios was in handcuffs, |
gave K9 Tyson the release command and removed him from the apprehension and placed him back
in my patrol vehicle. Rios was escorted to a patrol vehicle until medical personnel arrived on scene in
order to medically evaluate and treat him. Shortly after, Rios was transported by AMR to Natividad
Medical Center for further evaluation and treatment.

| then contacted Po who was the driver of the vehicle, and she provided me with the
following statement in summary.

Approximately 30 minutes prior to my contact with her, Miiiiwas at her residence located at 121 E.
Curtis St. when Rios arrived and began knocking on her window. [J asked Rios what he was doing
there and he asked her to take him to get food. [J knew there was a restraining order in effect
prohibiting Rios from contacting her or being at her residence. Therefore, MB decided to take him in
her vehicle in order to get him away from the house. [stated they drove to Safeway on N. Main
St. and were headed back to her residence when | initiated the traffic stop. | asked if Rios had
told her anything when I activated my emergency equipment and she stated no and that he just ran
from the vehicle. | asked [lif she heard me yell that he was going to be bit by the dog and she
stated yes.

This concluded her statement.

A records check of Rios also revealed there was a served criminal protective order from Santa Clara
County under case no. C1918460. Under this order, Rios is listed as the restrained person and

is listed as the protected person. Part of the terms include for Rios to stay at minimum 300 yards away
from

| asked [I if there was anything illegal in the vehicle and she stated no and gave me consent to
conduct a search, however no contraband was located. {J was then released at the scene.

| responded to NMC where | made contact with Rios and advised him of his Miranda Rights verbatim
per my department issued Officer Handbook. Rios stated he understood his rights by stating yes. Rios

advised me he wished to speak to his lawyer at which point all questioning and interrogation ceased at
this time.

| also contacted Rios' treating physician, Dr. Kincaid who advised me of the following. Rios sustained
a total of 3 wounds, 2 significant lacerations and 1 small laceration to the inner left thigh. The 2
significant lacerations where 8 cm and 5.5 cm in length. Rios also received 11 stitches and did not
sustain any broken bones or fractures. These injuries are not life threatening.

CSI Unit Officer J. Magana also responded to NMC where he photographed Rios' injuries and were
uploaded to evidence.

Once Rios was medically cleared by medical staff, he was transported to the Monterey County Jail
where he was booked for the listed charges.

and prosecution of Cesar Rios for the listed charges.

Re:
Officer Involved Shooting Review for Calexico Police Officer Alexander 
Hernandez #547 on February 21, 2024.  (ICDA BOI Case #24-01548, 
Calexico Police Case #24-001058)
I. 
Facts
The following facts are based upon bodycam footage, computer aided dispatch logs, and 
interviews of witnesses and involved officers  
On February 21, 2024, at about 9:43 P.M., Calexico Police Officers were dispatched to 736 
Grant Avenue in the City of Calexico for a report of a burglary in progress.  The suspect was 
broadcasted as Christian Plancarte (“Christian”).  The reporting party was Christian 
Plancarte’s mother, 
.  Officer Alexander Hernandez and Sgt. Miguel Carbajal 
arrived on scene at about 9:45 P.M.  Officer Hernandez and Sgt. Carbajal were in uniform.  
Upon arrival, Officer Hernandez and Sgt. Carbajal observed Christian at the door of the 
residence.  Both officers illuminated Christian with their flashlights.  Christian was holding a 
crowbar in his right hand.  Sgt. Carbajal yelled Calexico Police Department and ordered 
Christian to “Put that down.”  Officer Hernandez told Christian to “Drop it.”  Christian 
walked towards Sgt. Carbajal who was standing near the edge of the driveway.  Within a 
second, Christian then moved from a walk to a run towards Sgt. Carbajal.  While Christian 
was running toward Sgt. Carbajal, Christian lifted the crowbar up into a right-handed 
“batting” position to swing it.  Sgt. Carbajal, moved backwards away from Christian and 
ordered Christian to “Put it Down” several more times.   
As Christian closed the distance between himself and Sgt. Carbajal, Officer Hernandez, from 
the front yard, fired three shots from his service weapon striking Christian.  Christian fell to 
the ground approximately five feet away from Sgt. Carbajal’s position.  Christian dropped 
the crowbar as he fell.  

Page 2 of 4
Paramedics from the City of Calexico responded to the scene and provided medical aid.  
Christian sustained a single gunshot wound to the abdomen and grazing gunshot wound to 
his left thigh.  Christian survived his gunshot wound.  
During his interview by our Bureau of Investigation, Sgt. Carbajal stated that when Christian 
charged at him with the crowbar, he believed he was about to suffer great bodily injury.  Sgt. 
Carbajal told investigators that he feared for his safety and retreated backwards when he was 
rushed by Christian.  Sgt. Carbajal stated that he was in the process of pulling the trigger on 
his own firearm to shoot Christian, however Officer Hernandez shot first and stopped the 
imminent threat.  
During his interview by our Bureau of Investigation, Officer Hernandez stated that at the 
time Christian began running towards Sgt. Carbajal, he believed that Christian was going to 
strike Sgt. Carbajal with the crowbar and cause great bodily harm to him.  Christian ignored 
their commands to drop the crowbar and he therefore fired his duty pistol three times at 
Christian.  Officer Hernandez believed that when Christian started to run towards Sgt. 
Carbajal, Christian was about 15-20 feet from Sgt. Carbajal.  Officer Hernandez stated that 
within a about three seconds Christian was able to close the gap about 5-10 feet.  
Following the initial charging of a criminal case against Christian (JCF007622), a 
preliminary hearing was held on June 4, 2024.  Christian was bound over on charges of 
1) Attempted Murder of a Peace Officer, 2) Attempted Burglary, and 3) Assault with a 
Deadly Weapon.  Trial is currently scheduled for August 12, 2024.  
II.
Legal principles related to officer involved shootings
Possible criminal charges against an officer involved in a shooting not involving death 
include attempted murder (Penal Code § 187 and § 664); attempted voluntary manslaughter 
(§ 192 and 664); assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245); and assault by a police officer (§ 
149). (All section references hereafter will be to the Penal Code). To convict an officer of 
any of these charges it would be necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no legal 
justifications existed for the officer’s actions. (People v. Adrian (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 335, 
340-342.) Several possible legal justifications may apply in any given case and § 835a 
outlines some of those possible justifications as specifically applied to peace officers.
As is relevant in this matter, § 835a(c)(1) states that “a peace officer is justified in using 
deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the 
totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons: 
(A) To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to 
another person. (B) To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted 
in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause 
death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where feasible, a 
peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves 

Page 3 of 4
as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has 
objectively reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts.” 
§ 835a(d) states that “A peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not 
retreat or desist from their efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened resistance of the 
person being arrested. A peace officer shall not be deemed an aggressor or lose the right to 
self-defense by the use of objectively reasonable force in compliance with subdivisions (b) 
and (c) to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance. For the purposes of 
this subdivision, ‘retreat’ does not mean tactical repositioning or other deescalation tactics.”
§ 835a(e) clarifies some of the above sections by creating the following definitions: (1) 
“Deadly force” means any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or 
serious bodily injury, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm. (2) A threat of 
death or serious bodily injury is “imminent” when, based on the totality of the circumstances, 
a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, 
opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the 
peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no 
matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, 
from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed. (3) “Totality of the 
circumstances” means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, including the conduct 
of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.
The relevant Criminal Jury Instruction as written by the Judicial Council of California and 
set forth in CALCRIM 3470 permits a person being assaulted to defend themself from attack 
if, as a reasonable person, they had grounds for believing and did believe 
that bodily injury was about to be inflicted upon them or upon another person. In doing so, 
such person may immediately use all force and means which they believe to be reasonably 
necessary, and which would appear to a reasonable person, in the same or similar 
circumstances, to be necessary to defend against that danger and to prevent the injury which 
appears to be imminent.
The law as detailed in CALCRIM 3470 and in well-settled caselaw therefore permits a 
person, if confronted by the appearance of danger which arouses in his/her mind, as a 
reasonable person, an honest fear and conviction that he/she or another person is about to 
suffer bodily injury, to act in self-defense or defense of others upon such appearance of 
danger. The person’s right of self-defense is the same regardless of whether the danger to the 
person is real danger or merely apparent danger.  (People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 
639, 641-642.)  
The above justifications must be interpreted in light of United States Supreme Court 
precedent that limits the right of a police officer to use deadly force.  (People v. Martin 
(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1111, 1124.)  A relevant decision of the United States Supreme Court 
can be found in Tennessee v. Garner (1985) 471 U.S. 1, 11-12, where the Court outlined the 
constitutionally permissible parameters of the use of deadly force against a fleeing suspect: 
“Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious 

Page 4 of 4
physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to 
prevent escape by using deadly force. Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon 
or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or 
threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to 
prevent escape, and if, where feasible, some warning has been given.” 
The United States Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, determined 
that an officer’s right to use force is to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s 
“objective reasonableness” standard. As part of its analysis, the Court stated that “[t]he 
‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a 
reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Id. at 396. 
“The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are 
often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and 
rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.” Id. at 
396-397. 
V.
Conclusion
Officer Hernandez reasonably believed based upon the totality of the circumstances that 
deadly force was necessary to stop the imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to 
Sgt. Carbajal.  The bodycam footage of the shooting supported the statements of the involved 
officers that the threat of serious bodily injury was clearly imminent, and that the officer’s 
fear was reasonable to justify the use of deadly force.  Therefore, it is my opinion that 
Officer Hernandez is not criminally liable in his use of force in this matter.

Based on the information we have learned so far, the District Attorney’s office initial assessment
of the officer-involved shooting that occurred at the Circle K market at 1421 E. Ocean Ave. in
Lompoc on December 29, 2023, is that Officer Alex Justice was legally justified in his use of force
against Connor Amador. Our office will prepare a final and full report once we received the
complete investigation from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office.

Re:  
Officer Monay Officer Involved Shooting November 25, 2023 
 
Chief Reyna,  
 
The Merced County District Attorney’s Office has conducted an investigation into the fatal officer-
involved shooting by Officer Monay of Sergio Hernandez-Castillo on November 25, 2023.   
 
The purpose of the investigation by the District Attorney’s Office is to determine if any violation of 
criminal law may have occurred on the part of the officer.  A prosecutor should file criminal charges only 
if the prosecutor reasonably believes that the charges are supported by probable cause, that admissible 
evidence will be sufficient to support conviction beyond reasonable doubt, and that the decision to the 
charge is in the interest of justice.   
 
Possible criminal charges against Officer Monay are: Possible criminal charges against an officer 
involved in a shooting include murder (Penal Code Section 187); manslaughter (Penal Code Section 
192); assault with a deadly weapon (Penal Code Section 245); and assault by a police officer (Penal 
Code Section 149).  In order to convict an officer of any of these charges, however, it would be 
necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no legal justifications existed for the officer’s actions.  
(People v. Adrian (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 335, 340-342.)  Justifications for an officer’s actions are set 
forth in Penal Code Sections 196, 197 and 835a.   
Pursuant to Penal Code Section 835a, peace officers may use deadly force when necessary, in defense of 
human life.  A decision should be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same 
situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, rather than the benefit of 
hindsight.  The totality of the circumstances should include considering situations in which officers are 
forced to make quick judgments about using force.  Penal Code Section 835a further provides a peace 
officer is justified in using deadly force when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of the 
circumstances such force is necessary to defend against imminent threat of death or serious bodily 
injury. 

 
 
 
Page 2 
In this case, Officer Monay arrived on scene to assist Officer Cole on a call for service for an unknown 
person in reporting party’s backyard.  Prior to arrival, Officer Monay heard Officer Cole state over the 
radio that the suspect had a firearm.  Upon Officer Monay’s arrival, Officer Monay retrieved his 
department issued rifle.  Officer Cole had his firearm drawn and was giving commands to the suspect to 
“put [his] hands up.”  Officer Monay pointed his rifle at the suspect and continued giving commands in 
Spanish to raise his hands.  Officer Monay observed a firearm in front of the suspect on a brick wall.  He 
observed the suspect move toward the firearm with a “hand raised.”  Officer Cole continued to give 
commands, but the suspect continued to move his hand toward the firearm.  Officer Monay estimated 
the suspect’s hand to be less than a foot from the gun.  Officer Monay then fired five shots at the suspect 
through the fence.  Officer Monay fired because he was in fear that the suspect would shoot him, Officer 
Cole or the reporting party inside the house.  Officer Monay stopped firing once he saw suspect’s hand 
away from the gun.    
Here, officers gave the suspect several commands and opportunity to comply with commands before 
resorting to deadly force.  Officer Monay used deadly force when he believed his life and the life of 
others were in danger.  Officer Monay’s belief was reasonable and the use of force necessary to defend 
against imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.   
Officer Monay is justified in using deadly force in this case.  
 
Respectfully submitted,

FACTUAL SUMMARY

On Saturday, November 25, 2023, at 0914 hours, Los Banos Police Department Communications Center
received a call from MM reported Sergio Hernandez-Castillanos was trespassing in his
backyard at JH” Street, Los Banos, California. J stated that Hernandez-Castillanos had been in
his backyard for approximately 15 minutes and “was talking to himself.” Los Banos Police Department
(LBPD) Officer Cole was dispatched to the trespassing call at 09:16:26 hours. Officer Cole arrived at
WB “H” Street within seconds.

Officer Cole observed Hernandez-Castillanos in the backyard of JH” Street and broadcasted over
his police radio that Hernandez-Castillanos “appeared to have a firearm” and requested additional police
units to respond. Officer Cole gave Hernandez-Castillanos commands to “drop the firearm.” LBPD
Officer Ricardo Monay arrived at JH” Street, Los Banos at 09:18:57 hours to assist.

Officer Cole and Officer Monay took a position of cover behind a large tree in the front yard of| | | “H”
Street. A cinder block fence separated the front and back yard of the residence. There was a wooden
gate, approximately three (3) feet wide, between the cinder block fence and the residence that allowed
for access from the front yard to the back yard. The large tree where the officers were positioned was
approximately six (6) feet north of the cinder block fence.

Hermandez-Castillanos remained in the backyard while Officer Cole and Officer Monay were in the
front yard. Hernandez-Castillanos placed a black semi-automatic pistol, (later determined to be a “ghost
gun” or gun with no serial number or manufacturer markings) on top of the cinder block fence. Officer
Monay and Officer Cole moved from behind the tree and began to walk towards the wooden gate and
cinder block fence. As Officer Cole and Officer Monay made their approach, Hernandez-Castillanos
reached for the pistol. Officer Monay discharged his patrol rifle five (5) times, hitting Hernandez-
Castillanos with rounds through the wooden gate. Hernandez-Castillanos fell to the ground before
retrieving the pistol. Officers Cole and Monay climbed over the cinder block fence to gain access to
Hermandez-Castillanos as the wooden gate was locked. Hernandez-Castillanos was pronounced
deceased at the scene by Los Banos Battalion 1 fire personnel at 0942 hours. Officer Cole later
examined the decedent’s firearm, it was a real firearm that was not loaded.

INVOLVED OFFICER STATEMENT 
 
LBPD Officer Monay 
 
Officer Monay was interviewed on November 25, 2023, at 1435 hours. The interview was recorded via 
body worn camera, with only the audio function activated.  Officer Monay’s legal counsel, Nicole Pifari, 
requested the voluntary interview be recorded with no video.  The interview was conducted by LBPD 
Sergeant Parras and Detective Moreno.  I was also present at the interview.  The following is a summary 
of Officer Monay’s interview.  
 

 
 
Page 11 
Officer Monay confirmed he has been as a police officer for “just over seven (7) years.”  Officer Monay 
stated he has been with Los Banos Police Department “just over two (2) years.”  Officer Monay is 
assigned to patrol, with collateral duties of “officer in charge and field training officer.” He stated he was 
currently assigned to day shift weekends, Thursday to Sunday, 0630 hrs. to 1630 hrs.  Sergeant Parras 
confirmed with Officer Monay that there were three (3) officers and a Sergeant on duty at the time of 
this incident. Officer Monay stated he was rested before reporting for his shift, having slept “six or so 
hours” the previous night.   
 
Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay how the call for service at “H” Street came out and what 
information he had received.  Officer Monay said the call came out over his in-car mobile data computer 
or “MDC” and he opened the call.  The call was listed as “trespassing at a residence.” Officer Monay 
said the notes read, “Hispanic male adult, want to say said something to the effect of something like 
scruffy, on the property for about ten minutes, talking to himself.”  
 
There was radio traffic regarding this call that followed. Officer Monay said he remembered, “Officer 
Cole was diverted to the “H” Street address, that’s what I recall.”  When Officer Cole was diverted to the 
call, Officer Monay assigned himself to assist the call.  Officer Monay recalled that Officer Cole, put 
over the radio, he needed another unit because he thought the suspect, Hernandez-Castillanos had a 
firearm.  Officer Monay said once Officer Cole broadcast that Hernandez-Castillanos had a gun, he 
activated his emergency lights and siren and continued towards the residence. When he arrived, Officer 
Monay stated that he parked in the driveway of the “H” Street residence and that he saw that Officer 
Cole was the only officer on scene. Officer Monay deployed his department issued rifle and took a 
position to the left of the large tree in the front yard, where Officer Cole was standing on the right, with 
his duty pistol out and pointed toward the backyard of the residence. Officer Monay stated that Officer 
Cole was giving commands to the suspect in the backyard to “put your hands up.” 
 
Officer Monay explained that Officer Cole left cover behind the tree, and he told Officer Cole to “move 
back.”  Officer Cole moved back momentarily and then broke cover again.  Officer Monay said that at 
that time, he also broke cover, pointing his rifle at the subject in the back yard and shouting, in Spanish, 
for the suspect to “raise his hands.” 
 
Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay what he saw when he broke cover.  Officer Monay said he saw 
“somebody in the backyard of the residence, and they are a couple feet away from the wooden door and 
brick wall.”  Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay what he saw when he looked over the fence and 
Officer Monay responded, “What I see is umm a cement and brick wall, with a wooden gate, and then 
just immediately beyond, on the other side of that gate and brick wall, umm I could see the top portion 
of a man.”  Officer Monay clarified he could see “the top of his [suspect] shoulders and up but could not 
see his hands.” Officer Monay described Hernandez-Castillanos as “having dark black curly hair, dark 
brown skin, male and heavy grey jacket.” 
 
Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay what happened next, and Office Monay responded “So, after 
Officer Cole leaves cover, what I saw is the man on the other side of the fence begin approaching the 
fence.  So, it wasn’t until his hand went up in the air that then I saw there was a firearm on that brick 
wall, immediately right of the wooden gate, on top of the brick wall.”  Officer Monay confirmed that he 
did not see the firearm prior to his approach.  Officer Monay explained the firearm, a black semi-
automatic pistol, was laying on its left side with the barrel pointing west and the magazine pointing 
north.  Officer Monay said the suspect was moving toward the firearm “with a hand raised.” Officer 
Monay stated that he and Officer Cole were approximately 5-8 feet from the firearm. 

 
 
Page 12 
 
Although Officer Cole was continuing to shout commands, the suspect continued to move toward the 
firearm. Officer Monay recalled that “his (Hernandez-Castillanos) hand just kept on moving. The 
subject’s hand just kept moving” and Officer Monay stated he remembered thinking “How long are you 
going to wait?”  It was at this point in the interview that Officer Monay became audibly emotional as he 
recalled the moments before discharging his rifle. Officer Monay then indicated with his hand that 
Hernandez-Castillanos’ hand got “about a foot or less from the gun” and that’s when Officer Monay 
discharged his rifle in the direction of Hernandez-Castillanos. 
 
Officer Monay explained that when he and Officer Cole “were approaching and the subject was also 
approaching the fence, he saw the gun, it all clicks.”  Officer Monay said in his mind “now it’s a race for 
the gun.  When I see the hand approaching the gun, I made that decision to fire the rounds out of my 
rifle.  I only stopped firing because I saw his hand moving away from the handgun.”   
 
Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay what he thought Hernandez-Castillanos was going to do?  Officer 
Monay stated “So, in my mind, he was going to shoot at Cole, he was going to shoot at me, or he was 
going to shoot at somebody else in the house, and I couldn’t take that chance.”  
 
 
Sergeant Parras asked Officer Monay if he knew if Officer Cole had also shot at the suspect, and he said 
Officer Cole “did not shoot.”  Sergeant Parras then asked Officer Monay, when he was aiming his rifle, 
what was he aiming at?  Officer Monay said he began to lower his rifle on the approach because he was 
going to transition to his sidearm until he saw the handgun.  Officer Monay said as all this was going on 
he “was just point shooting.”               
      
Attorney Nicole Pifari asked Officer what type of patrol vehicle he was driving at the time of this 
incident, and he said a” Chevy Tahoe, number 005, fully marked patrol vehicle.” He confirmed that 
when he arrived at the residence, he had turned off the siren, but his emergency lights were still 
activated. Officer Monay stated that he was in full department uniform when he arrived on scene.  
 
Pifari asked Officer Monay if he had heard of the terms, “opportunity and intent.” Officer Monay stated 
that he had, and she went on to ask him if Hernandez-Castillanos had the means to harm him. Officer 
Monay responded, “He had a firearm, umm, in his presence and he did have the means.”  Pifari then 
asked Officer Monay, “When dealing with a firearms situation, would somebody have the opportunity to 
harm you with the firearm?”  Officer Monay said, “When they have it on their person or easily 
accessible.”  Officer Monay explained Hernandez-Castillanos “had the intent” when Hernandez-
Castillanos reached for the firearm.   
 
Pifari asked Officer Monay “Did you believe if he got his hands on that gun that he was going to try to 
kill you or your partner or other people in the neighborhood?” and Officer Monay responded “Yes.” 
Officer Monay confirmed that he and Officer Cole had not spoken to each other since they left the scene.   
 
Pifari allowed me to ask some additional questions of Officer Monay. I asked Officer Monay if he 
recalled ever responding to 
 “H” Street prior to this morning, and Officer Monay did not recall ever 
responding to 
 “H” Street prior.  I asked Officer Monay what was going through his mind, after 
Officer Cole put out over the radio that he was dealing with a man with a gun, while he was driving to 
 “H” Street.  Officer Monay said “to get there fast, but safe.  It is a life and death situation for Officer 
Cole if I don’t get there fast enough.” 
 

WITNESS STATEMENTS
LBPD Officer Cole

Officer Cole was interviewed by LBPD Detective Beltran and Detective Moreno in a conference room at
Los Banos Police Department on November 25, 2023, at 1250 hours. I listened to the interview live via
cellular phone. The following is a summary of the interview.

Detective Beltran confirmed with Officer Cole that he is a sworn police officer with Los Banos Police
Department (LBPD) and has been so employed for 11 years. Officer Cole was scheduled to work the
day shift on November 25, 2023, and was assigned to Beat 1. Officer Cole stated he was rested before
reporting for his shift, having slept approximately 7 % hours the previous night.

Officer Cole said he had been dispatched to this incident with a report only of “a male subject in the
backyard of ma “H” Street.” Detective Beltran asked if there was any description or additional details
in the call and Officer Cole said he couldn’t remember exactly what the description was. He believed it
was “an HMA” but could not recall specifics.

Officer Cole explained that when he arrived, he was initially at the wrong house first, then went to Jj
“H” Street. As he was approaching the front of the house, he “saw someone walking in the back yard,
HMA, long hair.” Officer Cole said that he thought he activated his body camera when he got out of his
patrol unit, however the investigation showed that no body worn camera footage was captured. Officer
Cole said he motioned to the subject in the backyard to “Come here.” Cole described this motion by
making a waving motion with his right arm as he was explaining this. He recalled that the subject was
not responding and “at one point he, I could see a gun clearly, in black handgun. He [Hernandez-
Castillanos] was pointing [the gun] east, behind the house. The house was obstructing my view of what
he was pointing at.” Officer Cole said that he drew his pistol and held it at low ready and began yelling
commands at the subject “to come to him.” Officer Cole requested another officer as backup to his
location and advised over the radio “he [suspect] has a firearm.”

Officer Cole said he thought there may have been a language barrier “since the guy was not really
responding to him.” Officer Cole described the suspect started walking towards him with the gun
pointed down towards the ground and stated, “If I remember right, he was holding the gun in his right
hand.” Officer Cole said he knows very little Spanish and the best he could come up with was “Armas
on the ground.” Officer Cole stated that the suspect, “wasn’t really listening” and they were separated
by a brick wall and a wooden gate.

Officer Cole recalled when Officer Monay arrived on scene and remembered hearing Officer Monay
“rack his rifle.” Officer Cole says by that time, he had positioned himself behind a tree and Officer
Monay approached on his (Cole’s) left side. He remembered that Hernandez-Castillanos started to walk
towards him, and “I can’t see what he is doing with his hands.” Officer Cole stated he yelled at
Hemandez-Castillanos “a few times to drop the gun in English,” and yelled “Manos arriba.” Officer
Cole remembered he was trying anything he could think of to get some sort of compliance. Officer Cole
said Officer Monay took over commands in Spanish, but Hernandez-Castillanos would still do what they
asked.

Officer Cole said that at one point the suspect then reached up and placed the gun on the backyard brick
wall. Officer Cole believed he started to advance toward Hernandez-Castillanos at that point, but he

Page 13

 
 
Page 14 
couldn’t be sure. He did recall that the suspect “then reached for the gun, placed his hand on the gun and 
hearing possibly 3 rounds but there may have been more.”  Officer Cole said that he and Officer Monay 
then began trying to figure out how to get over the brick wall, so he grabbed the gun from the fence and 
tossed it to the ground.  
 
Officer Cole said he went and got Officer Monay’s patrol car and moved it to the wall.  He used the push 
bumper to get over the wall.  Officer Cole confirmed that once he got over the wall, he handcuffed 
Hernandez-Castillanos began checking for injuries. Officer Cole says he could not initially locate any 
injuries due to the layers of clothing Hernandez-Castillanos was wearing.  Officer Cole did remember 
finding that Hernandez-Castillanos was holding a broken glass pipe in his hand.   
 
Detective Beltran asked Officer Cole what happened to the firearm Hernandez-Castillanos had. Officer 
Cole said when Hernandez-Castillanos placed it on the brick wall, he thought they had his compliance at 
that time.  But then Hernandez-Castillanos reached up again and placed his hand on the gun. Officer 
Cole said he was unsure if Hernandez-Castillanos “got a full master grip on the gun or not but he grabs it 
again.”  Officer Cole said he did not have the best vantage point from his angle to engage suspect, so he 
did not.  Officer Cole stated, “If it had gone further than that I probably would have shot.”  Officer Cole 
said that Officer Monay “recognized the threat they had, and he (Officer Monay) fired.” 
 
Detective Beltran and Detective Moreno showed Officer Cole a map of the location to use as reference 
in answering further questions. Detective Beltran asked Officer Cole how much he could see into the 
backyard of the “H” Street residence.  Officer Cole described that at the top of the wall there were 
square cutouts in the brick “so you can see through the top portion of the fence.”  Officer Cole said as he 
was walking up toward the fence, he could see Hernandez-Castillanos’ head and was only “maybe two 
feet” from the wall when making that observation. Officer Cole says he could see Hernandez-Castillanos 
in the southwest corner in the back yard, pointing a black handgun.  Officer Cole circled the area he saw 
Hernandez-Castillanos in on the map used by detectives during the interview.  Detective Moreno asked 
Officer Cole which direction Hernandez-Castillanos was pointing the gun, and Officer Cole said, 
“towards Second Street, toward the east.”  Officer Cole explained he could clearly see Hernandez-
Castillanos had “a black handgun with some sort of an attachment on the front rail” and that he 
remembered, “when he walked towards me, with it held low, it was in his right hand.”   
 
Detective Beltran then clarified with Officer Cole where Hernandez-Castillanos placed the gun.  Officer 
Cole explained it was “on the top of the cinder block wall next to the gate.” Officer Cole then placed a 
circle on the map indicating where Hernandez-Castillanos placed the firearm on the fence. Detective 
Moreno asks Officer Cole what he was able to see at that point and Officer Cole says “he wasn’t able to 
see much and that’s why he didn’t engage” but Officer Cole describes Hernandez-Castillanos reaching 
for the gun, on the fence, and that is when Officer Monay shot.   
 
Detective Beltran confirmed with Officer Cole that he did not fire his weapon.  Officer Cole explained 
he did not have the best vantage point.  He said that he “could see the top of Hernandez-Castillanos’ 
head, he could see Hernandez-Castillanos’ hand come up and touch the gun, but his angle was mostly 
fence and the cinder brick wall.”  Officer Cole said he had “more of the cinder brick wall in his direct 
angle, and he didn’t shoot.” 
 
Detective Moreno asks Officer Cole “What did you feel when you saw him [suspect]?”  Officer Cole 
said “I felt like it was coming close to the point I was going to have to [shoot].  I wasn’t sure what he 
was going to do when he grabbed the gun.  I didn’t know if the next thing that was gonna happen was, 

he was going to engage us. I was getting close to the point that I would have shot, but I just wasn’t quite
there yet I guess.”

Officer Cole stated he was familiar with Hernandez-Castillanos and “has seen him around.” Officer
Cole believed he had previous interactions with Hernandez-Castillanos on calls for service involving
trespassing but did not know the suspect by name.

LBPD Detective O’ Day interviewed the original reporting party, JJ and his wife, I on
November 25, 2023. The following is a summary of their statements which Detective O’ Day
documented in his original report.

called the Los Banos Police Department to report a male subject in his backyard, trespassing.
a said when the police arrived, he heard the police saying, “Drop the gun, drop the gun.”

said he also heard the police saying “Arriba manos, arriba manos.” [J was not able to see the
suspect in his backyard at the time he “heard three (3) gun shots.”

her what the phone number was to the police department. [said [J called the police and she heard
sirens. [said she heard someone from outside say “Drop the firearm, drop the firearm.” Jj said,
“a few seconds later she heard three (3) shots.”

SEARCH WARRANTS

Detective Beltran authored a search warrant for the property located at [J “H” Street in Los Banos, CA
and surrounding parcel lot —- Merced County Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN) 025-161-000. The search
watrant was served on November 25, 2023, and evidence was collected.

VIDEO

There is no body worn camera video of this officer involved shooting prior to the discharge of Officer
Monay’s rifle. After Officer Monay shot, both his and Officer Cole’s body wom cameras were activated
and the scene was captured from that point forward.

Officer Monay’s patrol vehicle in car camera captured this incident. Upon reviewing the in-car camera
footage, I noted the date stamp (11-25-23) and time (09:17:10) when the video starts. There was no
audio for approximately 30 seconds and at 09:17:40, the audio was activated. The footage showed
Officer Monay in his vehicle, traveling with his lights and siren on until he arrived at JH” Street at
09:18:45. Officer Monay pulled in the driveway and stopped facing south/southwest. Officer Cole could
be seen standing on the west side of a large tree in the front yard of the residence, with his service pistol
out and pointed in a south/southwest direction.

As Officer Monay got out of his vehicle and approached, Officer Cole could be heard saying, “Drop it,

push it over the fence,” at 09:18:58. At 09:19:17, I heard Officer Cole say, “Keep your hands above
your head.” At 09:19:24, I heard Officer Monay say “Manos arriba, arriba.” While giving these

Page 15

commands, Officer Monay moved to his left and approached the cinder block wall. Officer Cole then
moved to his right and began to approach the cinder block wall. At 09:19:29, Officer Monay fired five
(5) rounds from his rifle. At 09:19:32, “Shots fired” is put out over the police radio but it was not clear
from the video of it was Officer Cole or Officer Monay. Officer Cole then ran to Officer Monay’s patrol
vehicle at 09:20:00 and moved the patrol vehicle close to the cinder block wall, using it to get over the
wall and into the backyard of the residence.

MM Raven Lane, Los Banos

The residence to the west of JJ “H” Street is [Raven Lane. The resident, IE had
video surveillance cameras on his home that captured portions of his neighbor’s residence at jj “H”
Street. There was a total of fifty-nine (59) videos that were collected as evidence from the surveillance
system at [J Raven Lane. I reviewed all fifty-nine (59) surveillance videos but found that the large
tree in the front yard of the “H” Street residence obstructs much of the view in all the videos. I was
unable to see any movements made by Hernandez-Castillanos while in the back yard of ma “H” Street
on these videos.

 
  

AUTOPSY REPORT

I attended the autopsy for Hernandez-Castillanos on November 27, 2023, at 0900 hours. Dr. Sam
Andrews of NAAG Forensic PC performed the autopsy on Hernandez-Castillanos. At the time of
autopsy and later in his report, Dr. Andrews indicated the cause of death to be “homicide, multiple
gunshot wounds.”

Dr. Andrews further detailed in his final report dated January 31, 2024, that the cause of death was the
result of “gunshot wounds of the back” and manner of death was officially listed as “homicide.” The

INVESTIGATOR STRUBLE OBSERVATIONS

I, Supervising Investigator Jay Struble, went back to the scene at [J“H” Street, Los Banos on
December 15, 2023. I stood outside the cinder block wall, just in front of the large tree in the front yard
and looked into the back yard. I was standing approximately six feet from the cinder block wall, where
Officers Monay and Cole were positioned at the time of the incident, looking towards the backyard. I
was able to see over the wall all the way to the back fence. The top row of the cinder block wall has
blocks with square openings allowing a person to see through the open sides. I was able to look through
the openings in the cinder blocks all the way to the bottom of the back fence. From this position, I
clearly would be able to see a person walking in the backyard of J “H” Street, as well as a person
looking out from the backyard through the top row of cinder blocks as well as over the cinder block
wall.

In walking around the area where Officer Cole and Officer Monay were positioned, beside the tree, the

ground elevation is slightly higher (8-12 inches) than if standing at the base of the cinder block wall. As
mentioned above, I could see through the openings in the cinder blocks and see the bottom of the cinder
block fence in the back. To help put this in perspective, I am 5’10 and Officer Cole is 5’6. With the two

Page 17

of us being close in height, Officer Cole would have been able to also see the bottom of the back fence
as well. Based on this, Officer Cole would have been able to see Hernandez-Castillanos walking around
the back yard of JH” Street and also see him holding and pointing the firearm.

APPLICABLE LAW

California Penal Code, Section 196 details the circumstances when a public officer’s intentional killing of
another is justified. CALCRIM 507, a jury instruction, uses plain language to describe the elements of
Penal Code, Section 196, stating:

...1f he killed someone while acting as a public officer. . . [s]uch a killing is justified, and
therefore not unlawful, if:

1. The [person who killed another] was a public officer;

2. The killing was committed while overcoming actual resistance to some legal process or
while performing any other legal duty;

3. The killing was necessary to accomplish one of those lawful purposes;

AND

4. The [public officer] had probable cause to believe that the decedent posed a threat of
death or great bodily injury, either to the [public officer] or to others or that [the
decedent] had committed (insert applicable crime here) and that crime threatened the
[public officer] or others with death or great bodily injury.

Page 18

 
 
Page 19 
 
A person has probable cause to believe that someone poses a threat of death or great bodily 
injury when facts known to the person would persuade someone of reasonable caution that 
the other person is going to cause death or great bodily injury to another. 
* * * 
Great bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury.  It is an injury that is 
greater than minor or moderate harm. 
 
The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not 
justified.  If the People have not met this burden, [a jury] must find the [public officer] not 
guilty of murder or manslaughter.  (As was intended by the authors, the language above 
was modified or removed to correspond to the circumstances of this case.  Changes are 
shown in [brackets].  The full text of CALCRIM 507 is attached in the appendix.)  
 
A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed a public offense or is a danger 
to others may use reasonable force to detain or arrest the person, to prevent the person’s escape, or to 
overcome the person’s resistance.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a; CALCRIM 2670.)  An officer 
who detains or arrests a person does not need to retreat or stop his or her efforts if the person resists or 
threatens resistance.  Moreover, using reasonable force does not make the officer an aggressor or cause 
him or her to lose the right to self-defense.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a.)  The person being 
detained or arrested has a duty to permit himself or herself to be detained, and the person must refrain 
from using force or any weapon to resist arrest.  (People v. Allen (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 981, 985; 
California Penal Code, Section 834a; CALCRIM 2670, 2671, 2672.) 
A peace officer may use deadly force under circumstances where it is reasonably necessary for self-
defense or defense of another.  (California Penal Code, Sections, 196 and 197.)  California law permits 
the use of deadly force if the person actually and reasonable believed he/she or another was in imminent 
danger of death or great bodily injury.  It is the reasonable appearance of danger to the officer and 
his/her honest belief in that danger which is controlling.  If an officer actually believes that deadly force 
is necessary and that belief is reasonable under the circumstances, the officer’s actions are lawful even if 
it is later determined that the danger did not actually exist.  (CALCRIM 505, 507; People v. Toledo 
(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 577; People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.)  Further, the officer need not 
prove that he/she had the right to use deadly force. Rather, it is the prosecution which must prove that 
the officer did not have that right.

RE: Deadly Force Review Board Report and Findings

| have reviewed the memo dated March 26, 2024, authored by Lt. Gavin Wells regarding the Use of Force
Review Board Findings following an inquiry into the fatal shooting of Richard Pyorre (age 53) by Deputy
Ben Moore on November 16, 2023. | have reviewed the accompanying Internal Administrative
Investigation report (#2023-00014) and the accompanying attachments. The findings of the Deadly Force
Review Board were that Deputy Ben Moore's actions related to his involvement in a shooting on
November 16, 2023 were appropriate and within policy. | further found that Deputy Moore was in
compliance with applicable training, and that his use of deadly force in this situation was appropriate for

the following reasons:

* Richard Pyorre presented an immediate and severe threat to Deputy Moore at the time force was
applied.

* Richard Pyorre was in immediate possession of a firearm.

* There were no other reasonable options available to Deputy Moore. Use of impact weapons,
electronic control devices, pepper spray, or hands-on techniques were not viable options.

* Deputy Moore is well trained in use of force issues and techniques.

* Deputy Moore perceived Richard Pyorre to be an imminent threat to his life.

* Richard Pyorre presented a great potential for injury to Deputy Moore, other peace officers on scene and
to members of the public.

* There was an immediate need to prevent Richard Pyorre from continuing his activity as well as to
stop him from committing a firearm attack on Deputy Moore himself.

* Deputy Moore delivered deadly force until he no longer perceived Pyorre to be a threat.

* Deputy Moore's ammunition, uniform, and firearm were all in compliance with departmental
regulations.

* Deputy Moore appropriately used his recording devices to memorialize the incident.
RECOMMENDATIONS:

No disciplinary action regarding Deputy Moore's compliance with policies and procedures should be
brought against him.

Re: Officer Wilkins Officer Involved Shooting October 26, 2023
Chief Stanfield,

The Merced County District Attorney’s Office has conducted an investigation into the fatal officer-
involved shooting of Gilbert Garibay by Officers Wilkins on October 26, 2023. The criminal
investigation was led by the Merced Police Department. The District Attorney’s Office Bureau of
Investigations conducted a review of the incident.

The purpose of the investigation by the District Attorney’s Office is to determine if any violation of
criminal law may have occurred on the part of either officer. A prosecutor should file criminal charges
only if the prosecutor reasonably believes that the charges are supported by probable cause, that
admissible evidence will be sufficient to support conviction beyond reasonable doubt, and that the
decision to the charge is in the interest of justice.

Possible criminal charges against Officer Wilkins are: Possible criminal charges against an officer
involved in a shooting include murder (Penal Code Section 187); manslaughter (Penal Code Section
192); assault with a deadly weapon (Penal Code Section 245); and assault by a police officer (Penal
Code Section 149). In order to convict an officer of any of these charges, however, it would be
necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no legal justifications existed for the officer’s actions.
(People v. Adrian (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 335, 340-342.) Justifications for an officer’s actions are set
forth in Penal Code Sections 196, 197 and 835a.

Pursuant to Penal Code Section 835a, peace officers may use deadly force, when necessary, in defense
of human life. In decision should be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same
situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, rather than the benefit of
hindsight. The totality of the circumstances should include considering situations in which officers are
forced to make quick judgments about using force. Penal Code Section 835a further provides a peace
officer is justified in using deadly force when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of the

circumstances such force is necessary to defend against imminent threat of death or serious bodily
injury.

In this case, Officer Wilkins responded to a dispatch call surrounding a subject who was possibly
suicidal. Officer Kusomo also arrived on scene at some point to assist. While on scene, Officer Wilkins
stated over the radio that he had “one at gunpoint, has a knife won’t put it down.” He then stated,
“responsible walking towards us with knife.” Body camera footage depicts Garibay opening a folding
knife and Officer Wilkins then drawing his firearm. He warned Garibay to drop the knife. Investigators
estimated Garibay was approximately 10 feet from Officer Wilkins at this point. Garibay then advanced
toward Officer Wilkins while Officer Wilkins advised him to “drop the knife” seven times. Garibay told
the officers “shoot me” three separate times. Both officers continued to tell Garibay to drop the knife.
Officer Wilkins retreated as Garibay advanced with the knife as he continued to give commands
including “you’re going to shot, stop.” During the entirety of the contact, it is estimated that Garibay
advanced towards Officer Kusomo and Officer Wilkins over 78 feet as they retreated and gave
commands. After giving multiple commands and the subject failing to comply, Officer Wilkins fired
four rounds from his firearm. Officer Kusomo fired three rounds. Garibay died from gunshot wounds.

Based on Investigator Nelson’s training and experience, individuals with sharp weapons can present
fatal danger to others within 21 feet of others. Here, Officer Wilkins gave multiple commands and gave
Garibay several opportunities to comply before resorting to deadly force as Garibay closed the distance
between himself and Officer Wilkins. Although Officer Wilkins did not give a statement specifically
stating what his state of mind was at the time of using deadly force, circumstantial evidence along with
Investigator Nelson’s opinion support the conclusion that Officer Wilkins reasonably believed it was
necessary to defend against imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.

Officer Wilkins was justified in using deadly force in this case.

Respectfully submitted,

injury.

In this case, Officer Kusomo was on scene with Officer Wilkins and Garibay. It is not clear exactly
when Officer Kusomo arrived, but she can be seen and heard on Officer Wilkins body camera footage
and had her own body camera activated as well. Body camera footage depicts Garibay opening a
folding knife and Officer Wilkins then drawing his firearm. He warned Garibay to drop the knife.
Investigators estimated Garibay was approximately 10 feet from Officer Wilkins at this point. Officer
Kusomo was in close proximity to both Garibay and Officer Wilkins. Body camera footage depicts
Garibay advancing towards Kusomo and stating, “shoot me.” Garibay then advanced toward Officer
Wilkins while Officer Wilkins advised him to “drop the knife” seven times. Officer Kusomo told
Garibay to “drop it” five times and “drop the knife” two additional times. Garibay told the officers
“shoot me” three separate times. Both officers continued to tell Garibay to drop the knife. Officer

FACTUAL SUMMARY

On October 26, 2023, at 0055 hours, Merced Police Department (MPD) received a call from Jy
HE (01d the dispatcher there was a man in the center median of M Street, Merced who tried
to jump in front of his pickup. [J stayed on the phone with the dispatcher and made a u-turn so he
could keep an eye on the subject. Jj was still on the phone with the dispatcher when MPD Officers
Brandon Wilkins and Saggalih Kusumo arrived in the 3200 block of M Street. Jj was north of the
officers and observed the subject through his side mirror. When [J rolled down his window, he
could hear the officers’ giving orders to the subject, which included, “Drop the knife.” [ggg used his
cell phone to record the incident.

The subject in the median was later identified as Gilbert Garibay. Garibay walked directly in front of
Officer Wilkins’ patrol vehicle as Officer Wilkins arrived. Garibay was seen holding an object in his
right hand. Garibay then used his left hand to open the folding knife he was holding in his right hand.
Officer Wilkins unholstered his duty weapon and pointed it at Garibay. Officer Wilkins used a loud
voice and said, “drop the knife now.” Officer Kusumo also told Garibay to “drop the knife.”

Officer Wilkins announced over the radio that he had one person at gunpoint and that person had a

knife. Both officers retreated by walking backwards. Garibay stated, “Shoot me.” Garibay continued to
hold the open knife in his right hand and advanced towards the officers. Several more announcements
were made by both officers for Garibay to, “Drop the knife.” Garibay said “shoot me” two more times
and then began to walk faster towards Officer Wilkins. According to the measurements provided by
MPD’s Crime Scene Response Team’s diagram Officer Wilkins walked backwards approximately 78
feet and 10 inches. This measurement was taken from the left front tire of Officer Wilkins’ patrol unit
and where Garibay’s knife was found. Officer Wilkins then announced, “You’re going to get shot,
stop.” Officer Wilkins fired his duty weapon four times at Garibay, and Officer Kusumo fired her duty
weapon three times at Garibay.

Medical aid was provided to Garibay immediately following the shooting by Officer Wilkins.
Responding officers also assisted in providing medical aid and relayed over the radio that it was safe for
emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to come to their location. Medical aid continued until
Garibay was pronounced deceased at 0109 hours, by the Riggs Paramedic Jeffrey Kuhne.

DISPATCH LOG / RECORDINGS

I reviewed the 911 call made by gg and the radio traffic provided by MPD. The following
is a short summary of the 911 call to MPD Dispatch. gg told the dispatcher, “I just had a guy like
try to kill himself in front of my truck.” Jj explained that the “guy” was in the median and “he dove
in front of my truck.” J said he had to “swerve around him.” Jy described the area as M
Street, near Jack in the Box. JJ described the subject as wearing green pants and a black sweatshirt.
GE also added that the subject was wearing glasses and a tan hat. The dispatcher told gj that an
officer would meet with him. The dispatcher broadcast over the radio there was a subject with “913
thoughts.” This is the code for suicide. The dispatcher relayed that the reporting party was going to be
at M Street and Collins Drive.

The following is a summary of the radio communication between Office Wilkins and MPD Dispatch.

Officer Wilkins radioed that he was “out with both parties.” Officer Wilkins radioed, approximately 25
seconds later, “one at gunpoint, has a knife won’t put it down.” Nine seconds after that transmission,

Page 4 
Officer Wilkins radioed “responsible walking towards us with knife” and just 12 seconds after that radio 
transmission, Officer Wilkins radioed “shots fired, shots fired.”

Crime Scene Report  
 
The CSRT Supervisor Report was completed by Detective Matthew Calcagno.  Seven Speer 9 mm 
casings were located west of the southbound bike lane of M Street.  One bullet strike was found at 559 
Collins Drive, #2 (this is an upstairs apartment).  The casings and bullet fragments were logged into 
evidence by CSRT. 
 
BODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE  
 
Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo were wearing Body Worn Cameras (BWC) during this incident.  
The following is a sequence of still photos taken from Officer Wilkins’ BWC.   
 
 
 
The time of this still photo is 01:00:01.  Garibay walked towards Officer Wilkins as Officer Wilkins 
stepped out of his patrol vehicle.  Garibay had the knife in his right hand. 
 

 
 
Page 9

Within one second of the last still photo, Officer Wilkins drew his firearm.  Officer Wilkins told Garibay 
to “Drop that, drop that knife now.”  In my estimation Garibay was within 10 feet of Officer Wilkins at 
this point.   
 

 
 
Page 10 
 
At 01:00:14, Garibay said, “Shoot me” and advanced towards Officer Kusumo. 
 
Garibay changed his advancement towards Officer Wilkins.  By this time Officer Wilkins had ordered 
Garibay to “drop the knife” seven times.  Officer Kusumo told Garibay to “drop it” five times and “drop 
the knife” two additional times.   
 

 
 
Page 11 
 
Garibay told the officers “Shoot me” three separate times.  Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo 
continued to tell Garibay to “drop the knife.”   
 
 
At 01:00:44, Officer Wilkins announced, “You’re going to get shot, stop.”  In my assessment Garibay 
was steadily walking faster towards Officer Wilkins and an eminent threat to stab Officer Wilkins.    
 

 
 
Page 12 
 
At 01:00:46, Garibay fell to the ground after Officer Wilkins fired four shots and Officer Kusumo fired 
three shots in Garibay’s direction.     
 
 
When Officer Wilkins moved Garibay to provide medical aid, the handle of the knife could be seen. 
 
 
 
 

The following is a sequence of still photos taken from Officer Kusumo’s BWC. It should be noted that
Detective Rocha found an approximate two second discrepancy between Officer Wilkins and Officer
Kusumo’s time stamp on their respective Axon BWCs. Officer Wilkins’ BWC time stamp was two
seconds faster than Officer Kusumo’s.

 held his cell 
phone outside the driver’s side window of his vehicle and filmed the incident.  Both Officer Wilkins and 
Officer Kusumo can be heard saying “Drop the knife” several times.  This video had better lighting than 
the BWC footage and it could be seen that both the officers and Garibay move closer to 
  Officer 
Wilkins can be heard stating, “You’re going to get shot, stop.”  Officer Kusumo is heard stating, 
“crossfire” and then a large volley of gun shots.  This concluded 
 video.            
 
DOJ PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXAMINATION 
 
At the date of this report, physical evidence examination from the Department of Justice is still pending.  
Evidence items such as bullets, officers’ pistols, spent casings, Garibay’s knife, and a DNA card were 
sent by Detective Rocha to the Department of Justice.  The outcome of the examination will not affect 
the analysis in this report.   
 
INVOLVED OFFICER STATEMENTS

 did state that she lived in a separate house from her parents.  Gilbert’s 
wife, 
 was also present while 
 spoke to Detective Rocha.  
 stated Gilbert had 
woken up two nights prior and stated, “somebody was coming to get him.”  
 said Gilbert also said 
somebody in the family was going to “get him” and “everybody knew about it.”

 said, “No.”  None of the family members interviewed said 
Gilbert had a history of mental health problems.     
 
AUTOPSY 
 
On October 27, 2023, Forensic Pathologist Sam Andrews with NAAG Forensic PC performed an 
autopsy on Gilbert Garibay at the Merced County Sheriff’s Office Coroners Facilility.  Dr. Andrews 
determined the cause of the death to be “gunshot wounds.”  In addition, the other significant 
contributory cause(s) of death were “atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.”   
 
Garibay had gunshot wounds to his neck, two to the right side of this chest, right shoulder, right thigh, 
lower right leg, lower left leg, and a graze gunshot wound to the right side of his face.  The gunshot 
wound to Garibay’s neck caused major injuries to the thyroid gland, trachea, esophagus, spinal cord, 
thoracic vertebrae, and left lung.  The gunshot wounds to Garibay’s upper right chest caused injuries to 
his right lung, right clavicle, right ribs, and right arm.  The gunshot wounds to Garibay’s legs were soft 
tissue injuries only. 
 
Dr. Andrews’s incidental findings revealed enlargement of the heart; “moderate hardening and 
narrowing in the stented region of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle, a single 
gallstone, and “enlargement and nodularity of the prostate gland.”   
 
TOXICOLOGY 
 
Toxicology tests revealed Garibay’s blood was negative for ethanol and drugs.   
 
CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
No prior law enforcement contacts were located.  Furthermore, there was no exact match found when 
running a criminal history on Gilbert Garibay. 
 
INVESTIGATOR NELSON’S TRAINING AND EXPERENCE WITH EDGED WEAPONS 
 
Throughout my 25 years as a law enforcement officer, I have received ongoing firearm and defensive 
tactic training.  It has been consistently taught to me that edged weapon attacks are highly fatal.  In 
addition, a subject with an edged weapon has the ability to close the distance of 21 feet before I can 
identify the threat, make a decision and react properly with deadly force.

APPLICABLE LAW 
 
California Penal Code, Section 196 details the circumstances when a public officer’s intentional killing of 
another is justified.  CALCRIM 507, a jury instruction, uses plain language to describe the elements of 
Penal Code, Section 196, stating:  
 
. . . if he killed someone while acting as a public officer. . . [s]uch a killing is justified, and 
therefore not unlawful, if: 
1.  The [person who killed another] was a public officer; 
2.  The killing was committed while overcoming actual resistance to some legal process or 
while performing any other legal duty; 
3.  The killing was necessary to accomplish one of those lawful purposes; 
 
AND 
 
4.  The [public officer] had probable cause to believe that the decedent posed a threat of 
death or great bodily injury, either to the [public officer] or to others or that [the 
decedent] had committed (insert applicable crime here) and that crime threatened the 
[public officer] or others with death or great bodily injury. 
 
A person has probable cause to believe that someone poses a threat of death or great bodily 
injury when facts known to the person would persuade someone of reasonable caution that 
the other person is going to cause death or great bodily injury to another. 
* * * 
Great bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury.  It is an injury that is 
greater than minor or moderate harm. 
 
The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not 
justified.  If the People have not met this burden, [a jury] must find the [public officer] not 
guilty of murder or manslaughter.  (As was intended by the authors, the language above 
was modified or removed to correspond to the circumstances of this case.  Changes are 
shown in [brackets].  The full text of CALCRIM 507 is attached in the appendix.)  
 
A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed a public offense or is a danger 
to others may use reasonable force to detain or arrest the person, to prevent the person’s escape, or to 
overcome the person’s resistance.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a; CALCRIM 2670.)  An officer 
who detains or arrests a person does not need to retreat or stop his or her efforts if the person resists or 
threatens resistance.  Moreover, using reasonable force does not make the officer an aggressor or cause 
him or her to lose the right to self-defense.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a.)  The person being 
detained or arrested has a duty to permit himself or herself to be detained, and the person must refrain 
from using force or any weapon to resist arrest.  (People v. Allen (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 981, 985; 
California Penal Code, Section 834a; CALCRIM 2670, 2671, 2672.) 
A peace officer may use deadly force under circumstances where it is reasonably necessary for self-
defense or defense of another.  (California Penal Code, Sections, 196 and 197.)  California law permits 
the use of deadly force if the person actually and reasonable believed he/she or another was in imminent 
danger of death or great bodily injury.  It is the reasonable appearance of danger to the officer and his/her 

 
 
Page 18 
honest belief in that danger which is controlling.  If an officer actually believes that deadly force is 
necessary and that belief is reasonable under the circumstances, the officer’s actions are lawful even if it 
is later determined that the danger did not actually exist.  (CALCRIM 505, 507; People v. Toledo (1948) 
85 Cal.App.2d 577; People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.)  Further, the officer need not prove 
that he/she had the right to use deadly force. Rather, it is the prosecution which must prove that the officer 
did not have that right.

PROTOCOL JOINT INVESTIGATION (“INVESTIGATION”)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
SJSO DR# 22-21381; CHP 2022-03234; DOJ # 228337; SJC OME# 22-02688
and SJDA- BOI N--077-0927588

FROM: MARK OTT: CHIEF DEPUTY DA; HOMICIDE
SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY

  

The San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office has concludedats review of the San
Joaquin County Officer-Involved Critical Incident Protocol Joint Investigation (“Investigation”)
by the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office (“SJSO”), the City of Stockton Police Department
(“SPD”), the California Highway Patrol (“CHP”),; San Joaquin County’s Office of the Medical
Examiner (“SJCOME”), and the San Joaquin County District Attorney's Bureau of Investigations
(“SJDA-BOI”), of the fatal, solo vehicular collision occurring on October 8, 2023. The driver
and solo occupant, CHRISTAIN SHANE PANELA (“Panela”) (DOB: 08/20/1974), died from
his injures because of his vehicle collided with a tree and he suffered severe blunt force trauma.
Despite the immediate medical intervention efforts, Panela succumbed to his injuries.

After a thorough review of the reports, interviews, witness statements, documents,
photos, diagrams and evidence, including video footage, in the investigation, we have concluded
that the pursuing officers — San Joaquin County Sheriff s Deputy M. Doble (“Doble”), and San
Joaquin County Sheriff Deputy Q. Washington. (“Washington.”) both officers (collectively
referred to as “SO Officers”), — did not detain, arrest, or otherwise seize Mr. Panela by assertion
of authority or physical force. The actions of the SO Officers involved were lawful enforcement
actions and not the cause of the solo, fatal collision.

Therefore, no criminal charges are warranted.
FACTUAL SUMMARY

This review of the Investigation reports, witness statements, video review, photos,
diagrams, expert opinions, and evidence of the Investigation resulted in the following findings:

 

In addition, they were a distinctively marked SJSO Patrol Vehicle (“Sheriff's Vehicle”).
The patrol vehicle was a black and white Chevrolet Caprice with gold ""SHERIFF""
markings equipped with functioning siren, functioning overhead light bar and emergency
flashing red lights. Deputy Washington was operating the fully marked SJSO Patrol
Vehicle with his Field Training Deputy, Michael Doble. Deputy Washington had been
training with Deputy Doble for approximately four weeks.

On the date reference above, they were driving south bound on Filbert Avenue
approaching Main Street. AS they did so, they heard the sound of tire squealing in the
area. They opened their windows and determined the tire squealing was coming from the
west. Deputy Washington began to drive west bound on Main Street, toward the sound of
the tire squealing. As he did so, he saw a dark colored vehicle doing ""donuts"" in an
intersection. The vehicle was a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, (“the Pontiac”) and being
driven by Panela. Panela was observed doing approximately four ""donuts"" and ""spinning
out"" in the area of Main Street and Searchlight Avenue. “Donuts"" is a widely known
driving maneuver in which the rear or, front of the vehicle rotates around the opposite set
of wheels in a continuous motion, creating a circular pattern. This is typically
accomplished with near wide-open throttle acceleration, breaking traction of the driven
tires, while feathering the brake and throttle. One then steers in their chosen direction.
Doing donuts is a violation of the California Vehicle Code. See CVC 23103.

Deputy Washington made a U-turn to get behind the Pontiac and activated his
overhead emergency lights, which included a forward facing red light. Deputy
Washington aired that they were attempting fo stop a vehicle for reckless driving. The
Pontiac continued eastbound on Main Street. Deputy Washington estimated that the
Pontiac was traveling at approximately 50 to 60 MPH in violation of the posted speed
limit. The Pontiac made a northbound turn onto Filbert Street from Main Street and
accelerated. Deputy Washington noticed that his siren was not on and he activated it at
this point. Deputy Washington explained that some patrol vehicles are equipped to have
the siren turn on automatically when the code 3 lights are activated while some are not.
The suspect vehicle made one or two more ""donuts"" in the intersection then it drove
toward the deputies and passed them going eastbound on Main Street. Deputy
Washington made a U-turn to follow the vehicle. Deputy Doble said the suspect vehicle
""hooked the corner"" turning northbound on Filbert Avenue.

While at the intersection of Main Street and Filbert, Deputy Washington aired over
the radio, to San Joaquin Sheriff's Office Dispatch, that he was going to make a traffic
stop and that the suspect vehicle failed to yield. Deputy Doble aired the suspect vehicle
plate (California Plate 46EFP396). He aired that their ""want"" on the vehicle was for
reckless driving. Deputy Doble said that speeds at that moment approximated 80 miles
per hour, again in violation of the posted speed limit.

The Pontiac was traveling at a high rate of speed and did not slow for signal lights.
Deputy Washington was able to keep the Pontiac in his view at a distance as he slowed to
clear intersections. Deputy Washington indicated that the Pontiac failed to stop for
multiple red traffic signals. As the Pontiac continued northbound on Filbert Street just
south of the Crosstown Freeway, it pulled over to the opposite side (west side) of the

roadway and did one donut. The deputies continued northbound on Filbert Avenue
passing Myrtle Street with the suspect vehicle pulling away from them in northbound
lanes of travel. The Pontiac nearly collided into another vehicle at Filbert Street and
Fremont Street. The suspect vehicle ran the red light at Fremont Street. The Pontiac
swerved to the left (west) to avoid colliding with an uninvolved vehicle which was
traveling northbound in the #1. The Pontiac sped up and Deputy Washington estimated
at this point that the Pontiac was now traveling at 90 to 100 MPH. When the Pontiac was
approaching Harding Way, Deputy Washington lost sight of it as there was a curve in the
roadway. Deputy Washington estimated he was approximately 100 yards behind the
Pontiac. Deputy Washington said he heard the ""burning rubber sound"" when the Pontiac
was at Main Street and Filbert Street. During the pursuit, Deputy Washington saw smoke,
which appeared to be coming from the Pontiac's tires.

Deputy Doble aired out that the Pontiac ran the stop sign at Harding Way and he
had not seen the vehicle brake at all. Deputy Doble estimated the Pontiac’s speed to be
90-100 mph at that time he lost visual of the vehicle. As they continued through the
curve in the roadway and came to Harding Way, they saw that the Pontiac had crashed,
and was facing sideways in the roadway. Deputy Doble could not see anyone in the
Pontiac, and he was unsure if anyone was inside the vehicle or if they had fled on foot.

At this time, a second SJSO Patrol Vehicle arrived on scene. Field Training Deputy
Nathan MATCHAK and his trainee, Deputy Markus PALACIO, occupied the second
patrol vehicle. The actual collision occurred outside the direct line of sight of any of the
pursuing deputies or the other responding deputies. The entirety of Pontiac was severely
damaged.

Body Worn Camera (BWC) footage from deputies Washington and Doble was
activated at the scene of the crash. The suspect driver, identified as Christian Shane
Panela, was found inside the vehicle, laying across the driver seat and passenger seat.
His leg appeared to be pinned under the driver side dashboard of the vehicle. Christian
PANELA was laying across the front seats with his eyes looking to the ceiling of the
vehicle and was unresponsive. Deputy Doble said another unit arrived on scene and
assisted them with CPR. Deputy Doble, SJSO Deputies Matchek and Palacio attempted
to open the driver side door but it was too damaged to open. Deputy Palacios then
climbed into the vehicle through the driver side door and began chest compressions. He
was assisted by other the Deputies in providing CPR efforts.

Deputy DOBLE said the condition/position of the (driver's side) seatbelt was
unlatched. He indicated that it was “hanging”. He said the seat belt pulled a little due to
the way it was pinched between the driver's seat and the B-pillar from the collision. He
said it did not appear the suspect was buckled prior to the collision. Deputy DOBLE said
he cut the seat belt so that fire and medics could have better access to the suspect. Deputy
DOBLE was unable to open the vehicle doors. However, fire units were able to pry the
doors open. The fire department units took over advanced life saving measures upon
removing Panela from the vehicle. PANELA appeared to have severe injuries.

 

A subsequent search of the Pontiac, pursuant to a subpoena, found an “empty, 50 ml
New Amsterdam Vodka plastic bottle located on the front drivers floor board.

Asa result of this crash Panela sustained blunt force trauma of his torso, caused an
aortic transection, which resulted in acute blood loss and his death. Panela was
pronounced deceased at the crash utilizing telephonic protocols by Dr. Lima at San
Joaquin General Hospital.

It was determined that four parked vehicles suffered collision damage from being struct
by Panela’s vehicle and in turn propelled them into each other. There was no apparent
damage from a collision to any SJSO patrol vehicles involved. The distance from the
intersection of Filbert Street and Main Street to 1418 N. Filbert Street (location Pontiac
came to rest) is approximately | .4 miles. There are eight intersections controlled by
traffic signals and one intersection controlled by a stop sign. Railroad tracks cross Filbert
Street at two locations.

The postmortem examination of Panela included the collection of a blood sample
for toxicology analysis for Central Valley Toxicology, Inc (“CVT”). CVT detected the
presence of ethyl alcohol to be .18, a concentration (twice the legal limit o 0.08) and
detected the presence of Cannabis (delta-9-THC = 1.4 n/g/mL; delta-9-THC-COOH = 7.6
n/g/mL; delta-9-THC-OH < 1.4 n/g/m/L. Based upon these results it is opined that Mr.
Panela was under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs at the time of this crash.

It was determined that Panela was in violation of CVC for reckless driving while
doing donuts. He fled in wanton disregard in violation of CVC 2800.2. He was driving
while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, a violation of CVC 23152.

No police unit Vehicle or law enforcement personnel ever made physical contact
with Mr. Panela’s Vehicle or Mr. Panela prior to the collision. Upon inspection, the
Sheriff's Vehicle involved in the direct pursuit suffered no physical damage of any kind.

CONCLUSION

Based on evidence at the scene and witness' statements, it appears Panela was operating
his Vehicle on October 8, 20220n or about 2:27 A.M. in an unsafe manner, committing
numerous moving California Vehicle Violations, fleeing from a marked San Joaquin County
Sheriff Vehicle that had its forward facing solid red light and siren activated at a high rate of
speed. It would appear that during the pursuit, Panela even attempted to “taunt” the deputies by
continuing to taunt them with additional donut maneuvers. As Panel’s vehicle was heading
eastbound on N. Filbert at the intersection with E. Harding way, he was unable to stay on the
roadway and collided with a curb. Due to Mr. Panela’s high rate of speed, influenced no doubt
by his intoxication on alcohol and marijuana, he was unable to control his vehicle through the
intersection and cause the collision(s) that took his life.

Based on the evidence and statements it is apparent that Panela caused the collision by
being in violation of: (VC)23103 (a) Reckless Driving; VC 2800.1, Intention to Evade Peace

Officer in Motor Vehicle; and VC 2800.2, Attempting to Evade Peace Officer While Driving
Recklessly and being under the influence VC 23152.

Deputy Doble and Deputy Washington had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop
and detain Mr. Panela for moving violations, his immediate driving conduct while fleeing and after
he failed to stop. No SJSO Deputy exerted any physical force on Panela or the vehicle he was
driving. Mr. Panela’s death is attributable to his active flight and unsafe driving conduct which
caused him to lose control of his vehicle, while not wearing a seatbelt, resulting in his death.

In applying the prevailing legal standards, the totality of the circumstances, and in light of
all of the evidence obtained from the multi-task force Investigation, it is the opinion of the District
Attorney that the death of Mr. Panela was caused by Mr. Panela’s decisions and actions and
therefore, no criminal charges are warranted.

MEMORANDUM

DATE: Unecn i, 2024
TO: Carlos Mejia, POII, ID #7313
FROM: Adam Sharki, Captain, Central — | }24

SUBJECT: Notice of Reprimand and Disciplinary Transfer

This memorandum is being hand delivered to you to advise you of a disciplinary reprimand
and disciplinary transfer to another division. In addition to this reprimand and disciplinary
transfer, you will be required to complete two (2) hours of Equal Employment Opportunity
refresher training. This training will be completed on City time and paid for by the City.

On Labor Day weekend in 2023, you and other officers were in the line-up room prior to the
beginning of your shift. A female officer brought in food that her girlfriend had made for
everyone. In front of multiple officers, you offered to, “provide a baby” and essentially be a
sperm donor for the female officer and her girlfriend.

On October 14, 2023, you were talking to a couple of officers about a supervisor who was
allegedly cheating on their spouse. You said something similar to, “You can stick your dick in
whatever you want, bro. I don’t judge as long as you’re there for your kids.”

A disciplinary transfer is necessary because your comments of a sexual nature offended a
female officer assigned to Central Division. In addition, multiple officers who were
interviewed during the Internal Affairs investigation agreed that your comments were
inappropriate in the work setting. If you were to remain at Central Division, there is a
likelihood the same type of interactions would continue thus leading to future complaints
and workplace distractions.

You have violated Civil Service Rule XI, Section 3(b), (d) and (i), in that you have been
offensive in your conduct toward fellow employees, you have violated lawful or official
regulations, and you are guilty of conduct this is unbecoming of an officer.

a. San Diego Police Department Procedure 5.03 Equal Employment Opportunity,
revised September 2, 2021, which states, in part:

V. POLICY STATEMENT
A. Members shall be permitted a work atmosphere free from

discrimination and harassment of any form. Members shall not

harassment can be considered when assessing the facts and
circumstances of a later complaint.

Whether an alleged action constitutes harassment, as
defined above, will be determined on a case-by-case basis
by assessing the entire record and the totality of the
circumstances. Factors, such as the nature of the behavior
and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred,
will be considered in assessing the allegations and in
determining the appropriate resolution.

D. Sexual Harassment

1,

Sexual harassment is a form of illegal gender
discrimination. It is defined by law as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal,
visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

a. Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
individual's employment;

b. Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting that
employee; or,

c. Such conduct has the effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance
or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.

Unwelcome is used in the sense that the offended employee
did not solicit or incite the conduct and regarded it as
undesirable or offensive.

The following are examples of sexual harassment. Behavior
that constitutes sexual harassment as defined by this policy
is not limited to these examples:

a. Verbal harassment - sexual innuendo, sexually
suggestive comments, jokes, teasing of a sexual
nature, discussing sexual exploits, spreading rumors
of a sexual connotation, or continued requests for
social or sexual contact.

SYNOPSIS: 
On August 19, 22023 at approximately 2148 hours, Officers were dispatched to 
regarding a domestic disturbance. Officers were made aware that the 
male subject involved, Ernesto Carrillo (9/17/86) had an active felony warrant for PC 
273.5(a) (Domestic Violence) and PC 236 (False Imprisonment). Sergeant Puryear and 
other Officers were aware that Carrillo has a very lengthy history of being involved 
in 
domestic disturbances which included multiple felony charges. 
  
As Officers were arriving in the area, they received information that Carrillo had fled the 
area on foot. Officers were checking in the area in an attempt to locate Ernest Carrillo 
when State Center College Police Officer Gerrardo Serrano advised Reedley Officers that 
he had located a male subject matching Carrillo’s description. Officer Serrano gave an 
update stating this male subject was on Reed Ave. walking south bound from Kip Patrick 
Ave.

Multiple Officers were responding to the area when Sergeant Puryear located Carrillo 
walking south bound on the east side of Reed Ave. in front of Reedley College. 
Sergeant Puryear activated his emergency overhead lights and siren and was attempting 
to get Carrillo to stop. Carrillo was now running south bound and Sergeant Puryear 
observed something silver in Carrillo’s left hand. Sergeant Puryear believed this could be 
a firearm or a knife. Sergeant Puryear yelled “Stop Police” twice and Carrillo continued 
running while looking over his shoulder at Sergeant Puryear. 
Sergeant Puryear then yelled stop or you are going to get tased. Carrillo continued to run 
and Sergeant Puryear deployed his department issued Conducted Energy Device (CED). 
Mr. Carrillo fell forward on the concrete sidewalk causing visible facial injuries. Sergeant 
Puryear requested E.M.S. respond to his location Code 3 to render medical aid to Carrillo. 
E.M.S. 
responded 
code 
3 
and 
arrived 
approximately 
four 
minutes 
later. 
E.M.S. 
transported Carrillo to Adventist Health Hospital in Reedley. After receiving medical care 
at Adventist Health, doctors decided Carrillo needed better trauma care and ordered him 
to be transported to CRMC in Fresno. 
A short time later, Carrillo was transported to CRMC by ambulance with a Reedley Police 
Officer following in 
a marked Reedley Police vehicle. 
Early the next morning, Sergeant Puryear received information that Carrillo was in critical 
but stable condition.

SUMMARY 
There are two department policy violations alleged in this investigation and all are related 
to conduct. 
ALLEGATION 
1 
- Excessive Force (Section 300.3 
in 
part, of our Use of Force 
Policy)- Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears 
necessary given the facts and totality of the circumstances known or perceived by 
the officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement 
purpose. Exonerated 
Sergeant Puryear was responding to a call for service where the suspect (Carrillo) has a 
history of domestic violence and had a confirmed felony warrant for PC 273.5 (A) and PC 
236. Carrillo was running from police and had something in his left hand that appeared to 
be a weapon. This item was later determined to be a metal “window punch” which 
is 
commonly used to break vehicle windows. 
The findings of this allegation are Exonerated based on a report from Sergeant Puryear, 
statements from other Officers, Body worn camera footage and police reports. 
ALLEGATION 
2 - Excessive Force (Conducted Energy Device) Policy Section 
309.5.1) The CED may be used, when the circumstances reasonably perceived by 
the officer at the time indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary 
to 
control 
a 
person 
who: 
(a) 
is 
violent 
or 
is 
physically 
resisting. 
(b) 
has 
demonstrated, by words or action, an intention to be violent or to physically resist, 
and reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officer, themselves, or 
others. Exonerated 
Sergeant Puryear was aware of Carrillo's history of domestic violence. Sergeant Puryear 
also believed that if Carrillo had escaped, the female victim of the felony assault may be 
in danger if Carrillo believed it was her that called police. Sergeant Puryear also believed 
Carrillo may have had a weapon in his left had as he was running. The item in his hand 
was found to be a window punch during the arrest. 
The findings of this allegation are_Exonerated 
based on 
police reports, Body Worn 
camera footage and interviews

if the suspect was injured but believed he may have been due to an Officer requesting a 
“wash down” by fire personnel at the scene on Reed Ave. 
Dispatcher Lopez stated 
that the suspect who she can’t 
recall 
the name 
of, was 
transported 
to Adventist Health 
in Reedley by ambulance. She stated that she was 
advised later in the evening that the suspect was being transported to CRMC in Fresno. 
Much later, Sergeant Puryear asked Dispatcher Lopez to call CRMC to get an update on 
Carrillo’s condition, which she did. Staff at CRMC advised her that Carrillo was in critical 
but stable condition. 
Interview with Officer Luis Nava: 
On March 12, 2024 at approximately 0804 hours, 
| conducted an interview with Officer 
Luis Nava. The following is 
a summary of his statement: 
Officer Nava was working on the evening of 8/19/23 and responded to this call for service. 
He believes 
it was some type of domestic disturbance. As he arrived on scene and was 
walking to the reporting party's apartment, he heard the State Center College Officer 
advise over the Reedley P.D. radio that he observed a subject matching the description 
of the suspect. This subject was currently walking south bound on Reed Ave. from Kip 
Patrick Ave. 
Officer Nava walked back to his patrol vehicle and responded to the area of Reed Ave. / 
Kip Patrick Ave. As he was arriving in that area, he heard Sergeant Puryear advise that 
he had a “taser” deployment. 
Officer Nava arrived at Sergeant Puryear's location and observed suspect face down. 
Officer Nava placed handcuffs on the suspects wrists at that time. E.M.S. was requested 
to respond code 3 and arrived shortly after. 
E.M.S. personnel transported the suspect to Adventist Health Hospital in Reedley. Officer 
Nava followed Officer Delgado and the ambulance to the hospital. Officer Nava cleared 
this call at this time. 
Interview with Officer Anthony Jimenez: 
On March 18, 2024 at approximately 0800 hours, 
| conducted an interview with Officer 
Anthony Jimenez. The following is 
a summary of his statement:

Officer Jimenez was working on 8/19/23 and responded to the call for service related to 
this incident. Officer Jimenez stated that the reporting party was a female and the call 
was a domestic incident regarding the reporting party and her ex- boyfriend, Ernesto. 
Officer Jimenez is aware of multiple domestic violence related calls where Ernesto was 
involved as the suspect. As Officer Jimenez had arrived to the north of the reporting 
party's address, he heard State Center Officer Serrano advise that he observed a male 
subject matching the description of the suspect in this case on Reed Ave. near a house 
with a white fence near Kip Patrick Ave. 
Officer Jimenez responded to the area but turned north on Reed Ave. which was the 
opposite direction of the possible suspect. Officer Jimenez turned around and drove south 
on Reed Ave. At some point he heard an Officer advise they were making contact. Shortly 
after that, Officer Jimenez heard Sergeant Puryear request E.M.S. code 3. 
Officer Jimenez responded to Sergeant Puryear’s location and observed a male subject 
he knows as Ernesto, face down and bleeding. Ernesto was moaning in pain and trying 
to get up. Officer Jimenez advised Ernesto to stay down and E.M.S. arrived shortly after. 
Officer Jimenez too photographs of the area and of the blood on the ground. Photographs 
were booked into evidence. 
CONCLUSION 
  
After a thorough investigation into the allegations of Excessive Force by 
a member of this 
department, 
it has been determined that there is evidence to find these allegations to be 
false. This determination was based on interviews, police reports and Body Worn Camera 
footage.

Use of Force 
300.1 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy provides guidelines on the reasonable use of force. While there is no way to specify 
the exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every member of 
this department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, 
impartial, and reasonable manner (Government Code § 7286). 
In addition 
to those methods, techniques, and tools set forth below, the guidelines for the 
reasonable application of force contained 
in this policy shall apply to 
all policies addressing 
the potential use of force, including but not limited to the Control Devices and Techniques and 
Conducted Energy Device policies. 
Retaliation prohibitions for reporting suspected violations are addressed in the Anti-Retaliation 
Policy. 
300.1.1 
DEFINITIONS 
Definitions related to this policy include: 
Deadly force - Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily 
injury, including but not limited to the discharge of a firearm (Penal Code § 835a). 
Feasible 
- Reasonably capable 
of being done 
or carried out under the circumstances 
to 
successfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another 
person (Government Code § 7286(a)). 
Force - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents, or weapons to another 
person. 
It is not a use of force when a person allows him/herself to be searched, escorted, 
handcuffed, or restrained. 
Serious bodily injury - A serious impairment of physical condition, including but not limited to 
the following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment 
of function of any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious 
disfigurement (Penal Code § 243(f)(4)). 
Totality of the circumstances - All facts known to the officer at the time, including the conduct 
of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of force (Penal Code § 835a). 
300.2 
POLICY 
The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to the public 
and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and 
varied interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in carrying out their duties. 
Officers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and limitations. 
This is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in the performance 
of law enforcement duties.

Reedley Police Department 
Reedley PD Policy Manual 
Use of Force 
  
The Agency recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice to 
anyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to protect the public welfare 
requires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all interests. 
300.2.1 
DUTY TO INTERCEDE 
Any officer present and observing another law enforcement officer or an employee using force 
that is clearly beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer 
under the circumstances, shall, when in a position to do so, intercede (as defined by Government 
Code § 7286) to prevent the use of unreasonable force. 
When observing force used by a law enforcement officer, each officer should take into account 
the totality of the circumstances and the possibility that other law enforcement officers may have 
additional information regarding the threat posed by the subject (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
300.2.2 
FAIR AND UNBIASED USE OF FORCE 
Officers are expected to carry out their duties, including the use of force, in 
a manner that is fair 
and unbiased (Government Code § 7286(b)). See the Bias-Based Policing Policy for additional 
guidance. 
300.2.3 
DUTY TO REPORT EXCESSIVE FORCE 
Any officer who observes a law enforcement officer or an employee use force that potentially 
exceeds what the officer reasonably believes to be necessary shall immediately report these 
observations to a supervisor (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
As used in this subsection, ""immediately"" means as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. 
300.2.4 
FAILURE TO INTERCEDE 
An officer who has received the required training on the duty to intercede and then fails to act to 
intercede when required by law, may be disciplined in the same manner as the officer who used 
force beyond that which is necessary (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
300.3 
USE OF FORCE 
Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts 
and totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time of the event to 
accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose (Penal Code § 835a). 
The reasonableness of force will be judged from the perspective of 
a reasonable officer on the 
scene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for the fact that 
officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force that reasonably 
appears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information and in circumstances that are 
tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving. 
Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter, 
officers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the appropriate use of force in 
each incident. Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to

Use of Force - 2

Reediey PD Policy Manual 
Use of Force 
  
the seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened 
resistance (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
lt is also recognized that circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that 
it 
would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the approved or authorized tools, weapons, or 
methods provided by the Agency. Officers may find 
it more effective or reasonable to improvise 
their response to rapidly unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances, the 
use of any improvised device or method must nonetheless be objectively reasonable and utilized 
only to the degree that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement 
purpose. 
While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize injury, 
nothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before 
applying reasonable force. 
300.3.1 
USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST 
Any peace officer may use objectively reasonable force to effect an arrest, to prevent escape, 
or to overcome resistance. A peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not 
retreat or desist from his/her efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance on the part 
of the person being arrested; nor shall an officer be deemed the aggressor or lose his/her right to 
self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest, prevent escape, or to overcome 
resistance. Retreat does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation techniques (Penal 
Code § 835a). 
300.3.2 
FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE 
When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable 
force, 
a number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and circumstances permit 
(Government Code § 7286(b)). These factors include but are not limited to: 
(a) 
The apparent immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others (Penal Code 
§ 835a). 
(b) 
The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer 
at the time (Penal Code § 835a). 
(c) 
Officer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level 
of exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects). 
(d) 
The conduct of the involved officer leading up to the use of force (Penal Code $ 835a). 
(e) 
The effects of suspected drugs or alcohol. 
(f) 
The individual's apparent mental state or capacity (Penal Code $ 835a). 
(g) 
The individual's apparent ability to understand and comply with officer commands 
(Penal Code $ 835a). 
(h) 
Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.

availability 
of 
other 
reasonable 
and 
feasible 
options 
and 
their 
possible 
effectiveness (Penal Code $ 835a). 
(k) 
Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual prior 
to and at the time force is used. 
(l)

(n) 
Whether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight, or 
is attacking the officer. 
(o) 
The risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape. 
(p) 
The apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the 
situation.

(s) 
Any other exigent circumstances. 
300.3.3 
PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES 
Pain compliance techniques may be effective 
in controlling 
a physically or actively resisting 
individual. Officers may only apply those pain compliance techniques 
for which they have 
successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain compliance 
technique should consider: 
(a) 
The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level 
of resistance. 
(b) 
Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer. 
(c) 
Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply. 
The application 
of any 
pain compliance technique 
shall 
be discontinued once 
the 
officer 
determines that compliance has been achieved. 
300.3.4 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CAROTID CONTROL HOLD 
Officers of this department are not authorized to use a carotid restraint hold. A carotid restraint 
means a vascular neck restraint or any similar restraint, hold, or other defensive tactic in which 
pressure is applied to the sides of a person’s neck that involves a substantial risk of restricting 
blood flow and may render the person unconscious in order to subdue or control the person 
(Government Code § 7286.5).

300.3.5 
USE OF FORCE TO SEIZE EVIDENCE 
In general, officers may use reasonable force to lawfully seize evidence and to prevent the 
destruction of evidence. However, officers are discouraged from using force solely to prevent 
a person from swallowing evidence or contraband. In the instance when force is used, officers 
should not intentionally use any technique that restricts blood flow to the head, restricts respiration 
or which creates a reasonable likelihood that blood flow to the head or respiration would be 
restricted. Officers are encouraged to use techniques and methods taught by the Reedley Police 
Department for this specific purpose. 
300.3.6 
ALTERNATIVE TACTICS - DE-ESCALATION 
As time and circumstances reasonably permit, and when community and officer safety would 
not be compromised, officers should consider actions that may increase officer safety and may 
decrease the need for using force: 
(a) 
Summoning additional resources that are able to respond 
in 
a reasonably timely 
manner. 
(b) 
Formulating a plan with responding officers before entering an unstable situation that 
does not reasonably appear to require immediate intervention. 
(c) 
Employing other tactics that do not unreasonably increase officer jeopardy. 
In addition, when reasonable, officers should evaluate the totality of circumstances presented at 
the time in each situation and, when feasible, consider and utilize reasonably available alternative 
tactics and techniques that may persuade an individual to voluntarily comply or may mitigate the 
need to use a higher level of force to resolve the situation before applying force (Government 
Code § 7286(b)). Such alternatives may include but are not limited to: 
(a) 
Attempts to de-escalate a situation. 
(b) 
If reasonably available, the use of crisis intervention techniques by properly trained 
personnel. 
300.3.7 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF A CHOKE HOLD 
Officers of this department are not authorized to use a choke hold. A choke hold means any 
defensive tactic or force option in which direct pressure is applied to a person’s trachea or windpipe 
(Government Code § 7286.5). 
300.3.8 
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS 
Terms such as ""positional asphyxia,"" ""restraint asphyxia,"" and ""excited delirium"" continue to 
remain the subject of debate among experts and medical professionals, are not universally 
recognized medical conditions, and frequently involve other collateral or controlling factors such 
as narcotics or alcohol influence or pre-existing medical conditions. While it is impractical to restrict 
an officer's use of reasonable control methods when attempting to restrain a combative individual, 
officers are not authorized to use any restraint or transportation method which might unreasonably 
impair an individual's breathing or respiratory capacity for 
a period beyond the point when the 
individual has been adequately and safely controlled. Once the individual is safely secured, officers

should promptly check and continuously monitor the individual's condition for signs of medical 
distress (Government Code § 7286.5). 
300.4 
DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS 
Where feasible, the officer shall, prior to the use of deadly force, make reasonable efforts to identify 
themself as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has 
objectively reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts (Penal Code § 835a). 
If an objectively reasonable officer would consider it safe and feasible to do so under the totality 
of the circumstances, officers shall evaluate and use other reasonably available resources and 
techniques when determining whether to use deadly force. To the extent that 
it is reasonably 
practical, officers should consider their surroundings and any potential risks to bystanders prior to 
discharging a firearm (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
The use of deadly force is only justified when the officer reasonably believes it is necessary in the 
following circumstances (Penal Code § 835a): 
(a) 
An officer may use deadly force to protect themself or others from what the officer 
reasonably believes is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer 
or another person. 
(b) 
An officer may use deadly force to apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that 
threatened or resulted 
in death or serious bodily injury, 
if the officer reasonably 
believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless 
immediately apprehended. 
Officers shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person poses to 
themself, if an objectively reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent 
threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person (Penal Code § 835a). 
Additionally, an officer should not use deadly force against a person whose actions are a threat 
solely to property. 
An ""imminent"" threat of death or serious bodily injury exists when, based on the totality of the 
circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the 
present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury 
to the officer or another person. An officer's subjective fear of future harm alone is insufficient as 
an imminent threat. An imminent threat is one that from appearances is reasonably believed to 
require instant attention (Penal Code § 835a). 
300.4.1 
SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES 
Shots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective and involve considerations and risks 
in addition to the justification for the use of deadly force. When feasible, officers should take 
reasonable steps to move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their 
firearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants. An officer should only discharge a firearm at 
a moving 
vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means

available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is 
directed at the officer or others (Government Code § 7286(b)). 
Officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle. 
300.4.2 
DISPLAYING OF FIREARMS 
Given that individuals might perceive the display of a firearm as a potential application of force, 
officers should carefully evaluate each tactical situation and use sound discretion when drawing 
a firearm in public by considering the following guidelines (Government Code § 7286(b)): 
(a) 
If the officer does not initially perceive 
a threat but reasonably believes that the 
potential for such threat exists, firearms should generally be kept in the low-ready or 
other position not directed toward an individual. 
(b) 
If the 
officer reasonably believes 
that 
a threat exists 
based 
on 
the 
totality 
of 
circumstances presented 
at the time 
(e.g., 
high-risk stop, 
tactical 
entry, armed 
encounter), firearms may be directed toward such threat until the officer no longer 
perceives such threat. 
Once it is reasonably safe to do so, officers should carefully secure all firearms. 
300.5 
REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE 
Any use of force by 
a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely, 
and accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The officer 
should articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force was reasonable 
under the circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource allocation, analysis, 
and related purposes, the Agency may require the completion of additional report forms, as 
specified in department policy, procedure, or law. See the Report Preparation Policy for additional 
circumstances that may require documentation. 
300.5.1 
NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS 
Any use of force by an officer shall be reported immediately to a supervisor, including but not 
limited to the following circumstances (Penal Code § 832.13): 
(a) 
The application caused a visible injury. 
(b) 
The application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may 
have experienced more than momentary discomfort. 
(c) 
The individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain. 
(d) 
The individual indicates intent to pursue litigation. 
(e) 
Any application of 
a conducted energy device or control device. 
(f) 
| Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles, or belly chains. 
(g) 
The individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious. 
(h) 
An individual was struck or kicked.

As used in this subsection, ""immediately"" means as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. 
300.5.2 
REPORTING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Statistical data regarding 
all officer-involved shootings and incidents involving use 
of force 
resulting in serious bodily injury is to be reported to the California Department of Justice as required 
by Government Code § 12525.2. See the Records Center Policy. 
300.5.3 
REPORT RESTRICTIONS 
Officers shall not use the term ""excited delirium"" to describe an individual in an incident report. 
Officers may describe the characteristics of an individual's conduct, 
but shall not generally 
describe the individual's demeanor, conduct, or physical and mental condition at issue as ""excited 
delirium"" (Health and Safety Code § 24402). 
300.6 
MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Once 
it is reasonably safe to do so, properly trained officers should promptly provide or procure 
medical assistance for any person injured or claiming to have been injured in a use of force incident 
(Government Code § 7286(b)). 
Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits signs 
of physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury or continuing 
pain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of physical distress after 
an encounter should be continuously monitored until the individual can be medically assessed. 
Based upon the officer's initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject's injuries, 
medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff, or 
medical staff at the jail. 
If any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be 
fully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed by another 
officer and/or medical personnel. 
If a recording is made of the contact or an interview with the 
individual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible. 
The on-scene supervisor or, if the on-scene supervisor is not available, the primary handling officer 
shall ensure that any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following any 
use of force is informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a 
description of the force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would 
be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, 
impaired respiration). 
Persons who exhibit extreme 
agitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied 
by profuse 
sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain, 
or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple officers to be brought under control, 
may be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving these persons should be considered 
medical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a medical emergency should request 
medical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical personnel stage away if appropriate.

SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY 
A supervisor should 
respond 
to 
any 
reported 
use 
of force, 
if reasonably 
available. 
The 
responding supervisor is expected to (Government Code § 7286(b)): 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(h) 
Obtain the basic facts from the involved officers. Absent an allegation of misconduct 
or excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of 
duties. 
Ensure that any injured parties are examined and treated. 
When possible, separately obtain a recorded interview with the subject upon whom 
force was applied. If this interview is conducted without the person having voluntarily 
waived his/her Miranda rights, the following shall apply: 
1. 
The content of the interview should not be summarized or included in any related 
criminal charges. 
2. 
The fact that a recorded interview was conducted should be documented in a 
property or other report. 
3. 
The recording of the interview should be distinctly marked for retention until all 
potential for civil litigation has expired. 
Once any 
initial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been 
rendered, ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible 
injury or complaint of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These 
photographs should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired. 
Identify any witnesses not already included in related reports. 
Review and approve all related reports. 
Determine if there is any indication that the subject may pursue civil litigation. 
1. 
 Ifthere is an indication of potential civil litigation, the supervisor should complete 
and route a notification of a potential claim through the appropriate channels. 
Evaluate the circumstances surrounding the incident and initiate an administrative 
investigation if there is a question of policy non-compliance or if for any reason further 
investigation may be appropriate. 
In the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported 
application of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as 
circumstances permit. 
300.7.1 
WATCH COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY 
The Watch Commander shall review each use of force by any personnel within his/her command 
to ensure compliance with this policy.

309.1 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of the conducted energy device (CED). 
309.2 
POLICY 
The CED is used in an attempt to control a violent or potentially violent individual. The appropriate 
use of such a device may result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects. 
309.3 
ISSUANCE AND CARRYING CEDS 
Only members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be issued 
and may carry the CED. 
The Rangemaster should keep a log of issued CED devices and the serial numbers of cartridges/ 
magazines issued to members. 
CEDs are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving a particular 
assignment may be required to return the device to the department inventory. 
Officers shall only use the CED and cartridges/magazines that have been issued by the Agency. 
Cartridges/magazines should not be used after the manufacturer's expiration date. 
Uniformed officers who have been issued the CED shall wear the device in an approved holster. 
Officers who carry the CED while in uniform shall carry it in a holster on the side opposite the duty 
weapon (Penal Code § 13660). 
(a) 
All CEDs shall be clearly distinguishable to differentiate them from the duty weapon 
and any other device. 
(b) 
For single-shot devices, whenever practicable, officers should carry an additional 
cartridge on their person when carrying the CED. 
(c) 
Officers should not hold a firearm and the CED at the same time. 
Non-uniformed officers may secure the CED 
in 
a concealed, secure location 
in the driver's 
compartment of their vehicles. 
309.3.1 
USER RESPONSIBILITIES 
Officers shall be responsible for ensuring that the issued CED 
is properly maintained and 
in 
good working order. This includes a function test and battery life monitoring, as required by the 
manufacturer, and should be completed prior to the beginning of the officer's shift. 
CEDs that are damaged or inoperative, or cartridges/magazines that are expired or damaged, 
shall be returned to the Rangemaster for disposition. Officers shall submit documentation stating 
the reason for the return and how the CED or cartridge/magazine was damaged or became 
inoperative, if known.

309.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS 
A verbal warning of the intended use of the CED should precede its application, unless 
it would 
otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when 
it is not practicable due to the circumstances. 
The purpose of the warning is to: 
(a) 
Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply. 
(b) 
Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the CED may be deployed. 
If, after a verbal warning, an individual fails to voluntarily comply with an officer's lawful orders 
and 
it appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the officer may, but is not 
required to, activate any warning on the device, which may include display of the electrical arc, 
an audible warning, or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior to the application of 
the CED. The laser should not be intentionally directed into anyone's eyes. 
The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons 
it was not given shall be 
documented by the officer deploying the CED in the related report. 
309.5 
USE OF THE CED 
The CED has limitations and restrictions requiring consideration before its use. The CED should 
only be used when its operator can safely deploy the device within its operational range. Although 
the CED may be effective in controlling most individuals, officers should be aware that the device 
may not achieve the intended results and be prepared with other options. 
If sufficient personnel are available and can be safely assigned, an officer designated as lethal 
cover for any officer deploying 
a CED may be considered for officer safety. 
309.5.1 
APPLICATION OF THE CED 
The CED may be used, when the circumstances reasonably perceived by the officer at the time 
indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a person who: 
(a) 
Is violent or is physically resisting. 
(b) 
Has demonstrated, by words or action, an intention to be violent or to physically resist, 
and reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officers, themself, or others. 
Mere flight from a pursuing officer, without additional circumstances or factors, is not good cause 
for the use of the CED to apprehend an individual. 
The CED shall not be used to psychologically torment, to elicit statements, or to punish any 
individual. 
309.5.2 
SPECIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
The use of the CED on certain individuals should generally be avoided unless the totality of 
the circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear ineffective or would 
present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes 
that the need to control the individual outweighs the potential risk of using the device. This includes: 
(a) 
Individuals who are known to be pregnant.

Reedley Police Department 
Reedley PD Policy Manual 
Conducted Energy Device 
  
(b) 
Elderly individuals or obvious juveniles. 
(c) 
Individuals with obviously low body mass. 
(d) 
Individuals who are handcuffed or otherwise restrained. 
(e) 
Individuals known to have been recently sprayed with a flammable chemical agent or 
who are otherwise known to be in close proximity to any known combustible vapor or 
flammable material, including alcohol-based oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray. 
(f) 
Individuals whose position or activity is likely to result in collateral injury (e.g., falls 
from height, located in water, operating vehicles). 
Any CED capable of being applied 
in the drive-stun mode (i.e., direct contact without probes 
as a primary form of pain compliance) should be limited to supplementing the probe-mode to 
complete the circuit, or as a distraction technique to gain separation between officers and the 
subject, thereby giving officers time and distance to consider other force options or actions. 
309.5.3 
TARGETING CONSIDERATIONS 
Recognizing that the dynamics of a situation and movement of the subject may affect target 
placement of probes, when practicable, officers should attempt to target the back, lower center 
mass, and upper legs of the subject, and avoid intentionally targeting the head, neck, area of the 
heart, or genitals. 
If circumstances result in one or more probes inadvertently striking an area 
outside of the preferred target zones, the individual should be closely monitored until examined 
by paramedics or other medical personnel. 
309.5.4 
MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS OF THE CED 
Once an officer has successfully deployed two probes on the subject, the officer should continually 
assess the subject to determine 
if additional probe deployments or cycles reasonably appear 
necessary. Additional factors officers may consider include but are not limited to: 
(a) 
Whether it is reasonable to believe that the need to control the individual outweighs 
the potentially increased risk posed by multiple applications. 
(b) 
Whether the probes are making proper contact. 
(c) 
Whether the individual has the ability and has been given a reasonable opportunity 
to comply. 
(d) 
Whether verbal commands or other options or tactics may be more effective. 
Given that on certain devices (e.g., TASER 10™) each trigger pull deploys a single probe, the 
officer must pull the trigger twice to deploy two probes to create the possibility of neuro-muscular 
incapacitation. 
309.5.5 
ACTIONS FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENTS 
_Officers should take appropriate actions 
to control and restrain the individual as soon 
as 
reasonably practicable to minimize the need for longer or multiple exposures to the CED. As 
soon as practicable, officers shall notify a supervisor any time the CED has been discharged. 
If 
needed for evidentiary purposes, the expended cartridge, along with any probes and wire, should

be submitted into evidence (including confetti tags, when equipped on the device). The evidence 
packaging should be marked ""Biohazard"" if the probes penetrated the subject's skin. 
309.5.6 
DANGEROUS ANIMALS 
The CED may be deployed against an animal 
if the animal reasonably appears to pose an 
imminent threat to human safety. 
309.5.7 
OFF-DUTY CONSIDERATIONS 
Officers are not authorized to carry department CEDs while off-duty. 
Officers shall ensure that CEDs are secured while in their homes, vehicles, or any other area 
under their control, in 
a manner that will keep the device inaccessible to others. 
309.6 
DOCUMENTATION 
Officers shall document all CED discharges in the related arrest/crime reports and the CED report 
forms. Photographs should be taken of any obvious probe impact or drive-stun application sites 
and attached to the CED report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance 
with the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, audible 
warning, laser activation, and arcing the device, other than for testing purposes, will also be 
documented on the report form. Data downloads from the CED after use on a subject should be 
done as soon as practicable using a department-approved process to preserve the data. 
309.6.1 
CED REPORT FORM 
As applicable based on the device type, items that shall be included in the CED report form are: 
(a) 
The brand, model, and serial number of the CED and any cartridge/magazine. 
(b) 
Date, time, and location of the incident. 
(c) 
Whether any warning, display, laser, or arc deterred a subject and gained compliance. 
(d) 
The number of probes deployed, CED activations, the duration of each cycle, the 
duration between activations, and (as best as can be determined) the duration that 
the subject received applications. 
(e) 
The range at which the CED was used. 
(f) 
The type of mode used (e.g., probe deployment, drive-stun). 
(g) 
Location of any probe impact. 
(h) 
Location of contact in drive-stun mode. 
(i) 
| Description of where missed probes went. 
(j) 
Whether medical care was provided to the subject. 
(k) 
Whether the subject sustained any injuries. 
(l) 
| Whether any officers sustained any injuries. 
The Training Sergeant should periodically analyze the report forms to identify trends, including 
deterrence and effectiveness. The Training Sergeant should 
also conduct audits 
of CED

periodically be made available to the public. 
309.6.2 
REPORTS 
The officer should include the following in the arrest/crime report: 
(a) 
Identification of all personnel firing CEDs 
(b) 
Identification of all witnesses 
(c) 
Medical care provided to the subject 
(d) 
Observations of the subject's physical and physiological actions 
(e) 
Any known or suspected drug use, intoxication, or other medical problems 
309.7 
MEDICAL TREATMENT 
Consistent with local medical personnel protocols and absent extenuating circumstances, only 
appropriate medical personnel or officers trained in probe removal and handling should remove 
CED probes from a person's body. Used CED probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, 
similar to a used hypodermic needle, and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should 
be taken. 
All persons who have been struck by CED probes or who have been subjected to the electric 
discharge of the device, or who sustained direct exposure of the laser to the eyes shall be medically 
assessed prior to booking. Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following 
categories should, as soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical 
personnel: 
(a) 
The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/ 
or alcohol. 
(b) 
The person may be pregnant. 
(c) 
The person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention. 
(d) 
The CED probes are lodged in a sensitive area (e.g., groin, female breast, head, face, 
neck). 
(e) 
The person requests medical treatment. 
Any individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications 
shall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically evaluated prior to booking. If 
any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer and/ 
or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related reports. If an audio/video recording 
is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible. 
The transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that 
the individual has been subjected to the application of the CED (see the Medical Aid and Response 
Policy).

309.8 
SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
When possible, supervisors should respond to calls when they reasonably believe there 
is a 
likelihood the CED may be used. A supervisor should respond to all incidents where the CED 
was activated. 
A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to 
a CED. The 
device's internal logs should be downloaded by a supervisor or Rangemaster and saved with the 
related arrest/crime report. The supervisor should arrange for photographs of probe sites to be 
taken and witnesses to be interviewed. 
309.9 
TRAINING 
Personnel who are authorized to carry the CED shall be permitted to do so only after successfully 
completing the initial department-approved training. Any personnel who have not carried the CED 
as a part of their assignments for a period of six months or more shall be recertified by a qualified 
CED instructor prior to again carrying or using the device. 
Proficiency training for personnel who have been issued CEDs should occur every year. A 
reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skills may be required at any time, 
if deemed appropriate by the Training Sergeant. All training and proficiency for CEDs will be 
documented in the officer's training files. 
Command staff, supervisors, and investigators should receive CED training as appropriate for the 
investigations they conduct and review. 
Officers who do not carry CEDs should receive training that is sufficient to familiarize them with 
the device and with working with officers who use the device. 
The Training Sergeant is responsible for ensuring that all members who carry CEDs have received 
initial and annual proficiency training. Periodic audits should be used for verification. 
Application of CEDs during training could result in injuries and should not be mandatory for 
certification. 
The Training Sergeant should include the following training: 
(a) 
Areview of this policy. 
(b) 
A review of the Use of Force Policy. 
(c) 
Performing weak-hand draws or cross-draws until proficient to reduce the possibility 
of unintentionally drawing and firing a firearm. 
(d) 
Target 
area 
considerations, 
to 
include 
techniques 
or 
options 
to 
reduce 
the 
unintentional application of probes to the head, neck, area of the heart, and groin. 
(e) 
Scenario-based training, including virtual reality training when available. 
(f) 
| Handcuffing a subject during the application of the CED and transitioning to other force 
options. 
(g)

were struck by gunfire and the vehicle crashed a short distance away. An administrative
investigation was conducted that revealed that you violated several Martinez Police
Department policies during this incident.

RULES AND GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINE

Any future hearing officer or appellate body is advised that any one of the following
charges, standing alone, would support my decision to propose that you be terminated
from your employment as a Martinez police officer.

Is MARTINEZ POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY 300.3 - USE OF FORCE

Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary
given the facts and totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the
officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement
purpose (Penal Code § 835a)....

e On August 18, 2023, you responded to the scene near the Velvet Dispensary
shortly after the officers fired on the suspects and the car had crashed. One
of the suspects (who had been shot) exited the vehicle at the direction of
officers and was then handcuffed without resisting. As another officer was
dragging the suspect away from the vehicle, you lifted the suspect by his
sweatshirt and assisted in pulling him into the street. While pulling him, you

Page 2

delivered two or three knee strikes to the suspect’s head/face area. Given the
totality of the circumstances, the force was not justified because the suspect
was handcuffed, not resisting and was not disobeying any commands that he
had been given.

MARTINEZ POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY 300.5.1 — NOTIFICATION TO

SUPERVISORS

Any use of force by an officer shall be reported immediately to a supervisor,
including but not limited to the following circumstances.... As used in this
subsection, “immediately” means as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so.

On August 18, 2023, you responded to the scene near the Velvet
Dispensary shortly after the officers fired on the suspects and the car had
crashed. One of the suspects (who had been shot) exited the vehicle at
the direction of officers and was then handcuffed without resisting. As
another officer was dragging the suspect away from the vehicle, you lifted
the suspect by his sweatshirt and assisted in pulling him into the street.
While pulling him, you delivered two or three knee strikes to the suspect’s
head/face area. You failed to immediately notify the on-scene sergeant
that you had used force. Body worn camera footage from the scene and
witness statements make clear that there were ample opportunities right
after your use of force during which it was safe and feasible for you to
inform the on-scene sergeant, but you did not.

MARTINEZ POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY 320.4.5(0) - DISGRACEFUL

CONDUCT

Criminal, dishonest, infamous or disgraceful conduct adversely affecting the
employee/employer relationship, whether on or off duty.

After you unjustifiably kneed the suspect in the head/face area (while he
was handcuffed), you learned that he had been shot by the officers. You
approached the suspect and told him, “Play stupid games, win stupid
prizes.” Making that taunting statement to someone who had been shot
and against whom you had used unjustified force was disgraceful and
adversely affects the employer-employee relationship.

On August 18, 2023, you responded to a scene where an officer involved
shooting had occurred (Martinez Police Department Case # 23-1720).
While you were on scene, another Martinez police officer (who had shot at
the suspects) approached you and asked to have a conversation with you
with the body worn cameras turned off. You declined. A few seconds later,
after you had walked away, that same officer approached you again, with
both of his hands behind his back, apparently in order to conceal from the
view of your camera what he was holding in his hands (behind his back).

Notice of Intent to Impose Discipline, IA No. |A23-07 and |A23-08

Page 3

He asked you “Can you do me a favor?” There were two knives in his
hands. You reached behind the officer’s back and took the knives from
him, without asking any questions about the knives or why the officer
wanted you to take them. You then returned to your patrol vehicle, put the
knives in a backpack in your patrol vehicle, and then returned to where
you had been previously standing. Your acceptance and subsequent
storage of the knives in the immediate aftermath of an officer involved
shooting reveals that you did so for an illegitimate reason, most likely to
aid the other officer from being disciplined as a result of carrying the
knives. One of the knives is of a type that is prohibited to be worn on duty
and is also prohibited to be carried by anyone as a concealed weapon.
Your conduct was disgraceful and adversely affects the employer-
employee relationship.

4. MARTINEZ POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY 320.4.2(f) — FAILURE TO
REPORT

Failure of any employee to promptly and fully report activities on their own part or
the part of any other employee where such activities may result in criminal
prosecution or discipline under this policy.

On August 18, 2023, you responded to a scene where an officer involved
shooting had occurred (Martinez Police Department Case # 23-1720). While
you were on scene, another Martinez police officer (who had shot at the
suspects) approached you and asked to have a conversation with you with
the body worn cameras turned off. You declined. A few seconds later, after
you had walked away, that same officer approached you again, with both of
his hands behind his back, apparently in order to conceal from the view of
your camera what he was holding in his hands (behind his back). He asked
you “Can you do me a favor?” There were two knives in his hands. You
reached behind the officer's back and took the knives from him, without
asking any questions about the knives or why the officer wanted you to take
them. You then returned to your patrol vehicle, put the knives in a backpack in
your patrol vehicle, and then returned to where you had been previously
standing. Your acceptance and subsequent storage of the knives in the
immediate aftermath of an officer involved shooting, and without any
explanation from the other officer, indicates that you were aware that the
other officer wanted your help in covering up a potential policy violation and/or
criminal violation. You should have reported the other officer, but you did not.

5. MARTINEZ POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY 320.4.5 (aa) - CONDUCT
UNBECOMING

Any other on-duty or off-duty conduct which any employee knows or reasonably
should know is unbecoming a member of the Department or which is contrary to

good order, efficiency or morale, or which tends to reflect unfavorably upon the
Department or its members.

that is prohibited to be worn on duty and is also prohibited to be carried by
anyone as a concealed weapon. You should have reported the other officer,
but you did not. This reflected unfavorably on you and the Department, and
was contrary to good order and morale.

PRIOR PERSONNEL HISTORY

You were hired as a Martinez police officer in June 2021.

 

You have previously been disciplined for using unnecessary force in IA# |A23-02. In
November 2023, you received a 20-day suspension without pay based on the

Notice of Intent to Impose Discipline, [A No. 1A23-07 and 1A23-08
Page 5

unnecessary force you used on a male subject at the Amtrak station on April 1, 2023. In
addition to the suspension, you were precluded from conducting any training for three
years. In the April 1, 2023 incident, you used unnecessary force, failed to report your
use of force to a supervisor, and failed to document your force in an appropriate report.

 

LEVEL OF PENALTY

The use of force by a police officer is of critical concern to both the public and the law
enforcement community. You engaged in an unnecessary use of force towards the
suspect at the Velvet Dispensary. He was handcuffed and was not resisting any
commands at the time you kneed him. You failed to immediately report the force, and
instead found time to taunt the suspect by telling him, “play stupid games, win stupid
prizes.”

This incident occurred just months after | conducted a one-on-one training with you
regarding the use of force policy along with Commander Hurlbut and Lieutenant
Salamid. During that training, | reviewed the policy with you, including the requirements
to immediately report the use of force to a supervisor. Nevertheless, you have once
again used unnecessary force and failed to timely report it to a supervisor, and your
conduct in taunting a suspect, who had been shot, was disgraceful.

Your conduct regarding the knives given to you by another officer during this incident is
disgraceful and reveals that you cannot be trusted to perform the duties of a police
officer.

All of the rules you violated exist to ensure that the Martinez Police Department acts
with integrity, engenders and maintains the public trust, and mitigates potential liability.

| have no confidence that you would not continue to engage in this type of misconduct if
you were returned to your position as a Martinez police officer. For all these reasons, |
am recommending that your employment be terminated.

MATERIALS UPON WHICH THE PROPOSED ACTION IS BASED

The documents listed below support this disciplinary action and are attached to this
Notice. Your personnel file is not attached but may be examined upon your making an
appointment with Ms. Mariette Cesar, Executive Assistant to the Chief of Police, during

TO GIANI ARONE (""Appellant"") and his counsel of record and CITY OF MARTINEZ and its 
counsel of record: 
On October 22, 23 and 24, 2024, the Civil Service Commission (""Commission"") presided over 
the appeal of former Martinez Police Officer Giani Arone (“Arone” or “Appellant”) regarding his 
January 17, 2024 disciplinary termination from City employment for sustained findings of 
violation of various Police Department Policies, including but not limited to, Policy 300.3, “Use of 
Force.” The parties agreed to the schedule for the hearing to be conducted over three days on 
October 22, 23 and 24, 2024 before the Civil Service Commission, as a Step 3 disciplinary 
appeal, in accordance with Civil Service Rule 10.5.    
The appeal hearing was conducted in closed session in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in Civil Service Rule 10.5.  Pursuant to Civil Service Rule 10.5, the burden of proof lies with 
the City to prove the findings against Arone supporting the termination were sustained by a 
preponderance of the evidence and that the discipline of termination was warranted in light of 
sustained findings. 
During the three-day hearing, the Commission heard live witness testimony from former 
Martinez Police Officer Arone, Martinez Police Officer Mendez, Martinez Sgt. Espinoza and 
Martinez Police Chief Andrew White, and considered Exhibits provided by the City and also by 
Arone. Additionally, the Commission heard testimony from the Appellant’s expert witness, Sean 
McCann. The City’s case was presented through its counsel, Suzanne Solomon, Esq, and the 
Appellant’s case was presented through its counsel, William Baird, Esq, until both parties rested 
their cases and completed closing arguments.  The Commissioners, to wit, Acting Chair Allison 
Picard, Debi Mackey, Anthony Semenza, Ben Therriault and Yasmin Zand, then deliberated in 
private in closed session and voted unanimously to deny the appeal of Giani Arone.  
This written decision sets forth the written findings, conclusions and decision of the 
Commission, as required by Civil Service Rule 10.5h. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
Giani Arone was hired by the City of Martinez in June 2021 as a Police Officer.  Prior to being 
hired by the City of Martinez, Arone had worked for the City of Oakland as a Police Officer for 
approximately 6 ½ years.  He left the City of Oakland in good standing.  A veteran of the U.S. 
Army, having seen three years of active duty during deployment between 2011-2014, Arone had 

379477.1
2 
experienced stressful situations in combat, as well as when he served as a Police Officer in the 
City of Oakland.  While working in the City of Oakland, Arone estimated he had been involved in 
responses to over 100 shootings, and five officer-involved shootings. 
During Arone’s employment with the City of Martinez, he was assigned to teach “defensive 
tactics,” including use of force.  In order to qualify to teach this subject to other officers, Arone 
testified that he took approximately 80 hours of coursework with the Alameda County Sheriff’s 
Office on this subject [City Ex.11-5, lines 215-225].  Arone testified that he taught defensive 
tactics classes to other Martinez officers, most recently in December 2022. 
On August 18, 2023, Officer Arone was working the night shift (6:00 am to 6:00 pm), when at 
approximately 3:30 am, he was dispatched to the Velvet Dispensary located at 4808 Sunrise 
Drive, Martinez to respond to a burglary in progress, assault on an officer with a report of shots 
having been fired.  As shown on Officer Arone’s body-worn camera footage, upon Officer 
Arone’s arrival he observed a crashed vehicle, a fire hydrant which had been knocked over and 
was gushing a vertical column of water, and several officers surrounding the suspect’s vehicle 
with drawn guns shouting orders to the occupants. Arone joined with the other Martinez police 
officers and approached the vehicle from the driver’s side.  The windows were rolled up and 
darkly tinted and Officer Arone used his baton to smash the driver-side front and rear windows.  
The interior of the vehicle was still obscured due to the deployed airbag and Officer Arone used 
his baton to lift the airbag to be able to look into the suspect’s vehicle for occupants and 
potential weapons. 
While Officer Arone was focused on the driver side of the suspect’s vehicle, suspect Thomas 
Wilson was ordered by another officer on the passenger side of the vehicle to crawl out through 
the passenger window, which Wilson did.  As shown on the body-worn camera of Officer 
Mendez, Wilson was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back by Officer Mendez, a 
rookie police officer.  Wilson was ordered to “stand up,” but did not.  While Mendez turned 
Wilson from his back (with hands secured) to his front, Wilson yelled “I’m hit by a fucking bullet, 
bitch” and began moaning.  Upon direction from his Field Training Officer Kahue, Officer 
Mendez then began dragging Wilson under his left armpit, face up with Wilson’s arms secured 
behind his back, around the back of the suspect’s vehicle and into the street.  Wilson (who had 
been shot in the police encounter) continued moaning. 
Officer Arone, after determining that the driver of the suspect’s vehicle was not a threat, came 
around the back of the suspect’s vehicle to assist Officer Mendez and lifted Wilson by the front 
of his sweatshirt, while Mendez continued to drag Wilson by his grip under Wilson’s left arm pit. 
Within a couple seconds of grabbing Wilson by his sweatshirt, Officer Arone delivered two to 
three knee strikes with his right knee to Wilson’s face/head area.  Wilson yelled “he’s kneeing 
me, he’s kneeing me!”  Prior to the knee strikes neither Officer Arone or Officer Mendez had 
provided any commands to Wilson as they were dragging him into the street, including any 
commands to stop resisting. Wilson was then flipped over and Officer Arone walked away from 
Wilson, who was restrained by handcuffs. 
Paramedics arrived at the scene within a few minutes of the use of force incident by Arone 
(knee to Wilson face/head area).  Within approximately 7 minutes of the use of force incident, 
paramedics or police determined that Thomas Wilson’s brother (the driver of the suspect’s 
vehicle) was deceased in the vehicle, and Thomas Wilson yelled, “you killed my brother!”  Arone 
responded to Thomas Wilson, “Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.” 

379477.1
3 
Approximately 30 minutes after the use of force incident, (as shown on Officer Arone’s body-
worn camera), Officer Arone was approached by Officer Bennett who asked him for “a favor.”  
Officer Bennett handed something to Officer Arone from behind his back, in a sideways gesture 
which did not reveal the nature of the item Bennett transferred to Arone.  The item or items 
transferred were one or two knives, which Officer Bennett had on his person at the time of his 
response to the crime scene.  Arone took the items without question and walked to his vehicle, 
took out a roll of crime scene tape and then transferred the items given to him by Bennett to his 
bag, concealed from clear body-worn camera view by the crime scene tape he also held in his 
hand. 
Officer Arone did not know whether Officer Bennett was one of the officers who had fired his 
service firearm at the suspects at the scene, nor did he ask Officer Bennett whether he had fired 
his firearm.  In fact, Officer Bennett was one of the Officers who had fired their service firearm in 
an “officer-involved shooting.” 
REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL CHARGES 
This Commission reviewed the evidence presented at the appeal hearing, including the City’s 
Exhibits and Arone’s Exhibits, to determine whether each charge of City Policy violation charged 
against Arone could be sustained by a preponderance of evidence. 
CHARGE 1. 
Did Officer Arone violate the City Police Department Use of Force Policy 
300.3 by delivering knee strikes to the face/head area of the suspect? 
The City’s Use of Force Policy 300.3 states that “Officers shall use only that amount of force 
that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and totality of the circumstances known to or 
perceived by the officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement 
purpose.” [City Ex. 5].  
Additionally, according to the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training 
(P.O.S.T.), Basic Course Workbook Series, Learning Domain 20 on Use of Force/De-escalation, 
Version 5.4 [City Ex. 23, page 1-6] “the reasonable officer standard” is “would another officer 
facing like or similar circumstances, act in the same way or use similar judgment?”   
Arone testified that knee strikes were reasonable force to gain Wilson’s compliance as he was 
being drug by Officer Mendez.  Arone explained he did not know that Wilson was handcuffed at 
the time he delivered the knee strikes or that Wilson had been shot, that Wilson was “dropping 
his weight” and that he felt Wilson “tightening his arms” as a form of resistance while he was 
being dragged by Officer Mendez.  Arone testified that although Wilson was moaning, suspects 
often fake pain or cry out as a delaying tactic and that he believed Wilson had the ability to 
stand up. [City Ex. 9-35]  Arone also testified that he did not see Officer Mendez handcuff 
Wilson on the passenger side of the suspect’s vehicle, and that he could not distinguish that 
Wilson was handcuffed because the handcuffs were black in color, Wilson has dark skin 
(African American) and he was wearing a black sweatshirt and black gloves.  
Contrary evidence exists.  Officer Mendez testified both at the appeal hearing and during the 
Internal Affairs investigation that while Wilson was “heavy” he was not resisting.  [City EX 9-17; 
9-42, 9-43]  Officer Mendez also testified that Wilson was given no commands immediately prior
to the knee strikes being administered by Officer Arone.

379477.1
4 
As seen in the body-worn camera displayed at the appeal hearing and as found by the Internal 
Affairs investigator, Chaplin & Hill [City Ex. 9-43], it should have been apparent to Officer Arone 
by the way that Wilson was being dragged under his left arm by Officer Mendez, face up with 
hands behind his back, that Wilson’s hands were secured behind his back.  Because Officer 
Arone had only grabbed Wilson by the sweatshirt and did not touch his arms, he could not have 
felt Wilson “tightening his arms.” There is no evidence that Wilson was resisting, no commands 
were given before the knee strikes were administered to the face/head area.  It is apparent in 
reviewing the body-worn camera that Officer Arone did not check on the status of Wilson’s 
hands at any point prior to administering knee strikes.  Arone also testified that his focus was on 
Wilson’s head and not his hands. Accordingly, Arone’s testimony that he could not tell if Wilson 
was handcuffed because of Wilson’s black sweatshirt, black gloves, dark skin color and black 
handcuffs is inconsistent with the fact that he did not look at Wilson’s hands prior to the knee 
strikes, after which Wilson was flipped over on his stomach.  
Arone’s expert witness, Sean McCann testified that in his opinion the knee strikes to the 
face/head were “not justified” and that Arone’s conduct “was in error, but excusable under 
stress.”  Police Chief White testified that even if Wilson had not been shot, had not been 
handcuffed and was “dropping his weight,” knee strikes to the face/head would not be 
reasonable force. If Arone believed that Wilson had the ability to stand, it is not reasonable that 
knee strikes to the face/head would facilitate a suspect’s ability to do so and instead had the 
potential for serious injury. Arone did not command Wilson to stand at any time before delivering 
the knee strikes to his face/head. 
Finally, while Arone and other Officers have the responsibility to understand the Use of Force 
and other Police Department policies, Arone had actually been an instructor on “defensive 
tactics” including use of force for the Martinez Police Department as recently as December 
2022, and had received retraining on the use of force policy in June 2023.  
Charge 1 is SUSTAINED.  The Commission finds that based on a preponderance of evidence 
that the knee strikes administered to Wilson were not reasonable or necessary given the facts 
and totality of the circumstances to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose, in 
violation of City Police Department Policy 300.3. 
CHARGE 2. 
Did Officer Arone violate City Police Department Policy 300.5.1 by 
failing to immediately notify his supervisor of his use of force? 
Policy 300.5.1 states that “Any use of force by an officer shall be reported immediately to a 
supervisor, including but not limited to the following circumstances…As used in this subsection, 
“immediately” means as soon as safe and feasible to do so.” 
The supervisor and watch commander at the Velvet Dispensary incident scene was Sgt. 
Espinoza, a 22 year veteran in law enforcement.  Sgt. Espinoza testified that he did not see 
Officer Arone’s use of force on Wilson at the scene. Sgt. Espinoza also testified that the 
purpose of the use of force reporting policy was to enable the watch commander to take or 
direct the taking of photographs of the recipient of the use of force, determine whether medical 
treatment was required at the scene, and preserve evidence for the use of force incident. It is 
undisputed that no photographs or preservation of evidence of the use of force occurred at the 
scene. 
The facts are disputed as to whether Officer Arone actually notified his supervisor, Sgt. 
Espinoza, of his use of force (knee strikes to Wilson) at the August 18, 2023 scene of the 

379477.1
5 
incident. Officer Arone stated that he did advise Sgt. Espinoza of the use of force shortly after 
he went off body-worn camera in order to call the POA union representative regarding the police 
response, and that this occurred within the initial 30 minutes of the police response.  [City 
Ex.11-25]  Arone stated that when he told Sgt. Espinoza “Hey, by the way, I threw some knee 
strikes at the subject because he was resisting,” that Sgt. Espinoza responded by saying 
something like, “I think that is the least of the worries, but just make sure you put it in your 
report.” 
In contrast, Sgt. Espinoza testified that he does not recall Arone advising him of the use of force 
at the scene, and there is no evidence on Sgt. Espinoza’s body-worn camera that Officer Arone 
did in fact notify him of the use of force; Sgt. Espinoza’s body-worn camera was on continuously 
for 35 minutes after the use of force incident.  Sgt. Espinoza further stated that Officer Arone did 
not advise him of the use of force incident until the following day at the police station.  Sgt. 
Espinoza stated that when Arone did tell him about the use of force incident the next day at the 
police station his reaction was “What the fuck?!” and he then directed Arone to write a 
supplemental report, noting that the supplemental report should state that it was prepared “to 
the best of his recollection” without review of the body-worn camera. Arone’s supplemental 
report was prepared on August 21, 2023, which is three days after the August 18, 2023 Velvet 
Dispensary incident.  [City Ex. 10-1].  The supplemental report was not presented to Sgt. 
Espinoza for review, but was approved by a different supervisor on August 25, 2023. 
It is also apparent from the body-worn camera footage that there were many opportunities for 
Officer Arone to have notified Sgt. Espinoza within 30 or 35 minutes after the use of force on 
Wilson, as the paramedics were on the scene within a matter of minutes and that the scene had 
been secured.  Arone’s body-worn camera footage shows that he turned his camera off (to talk 
to his union representative) at 28 minutes after the use of force incident, and within 30 minutes 
Officer Arone and Officer Bennett are seen standing apart regarding the transfer of Bennett’s 
knives to Arone.  During this period (and even up to 35 minutes from the use of force incident) 
there is no recording of Arone advising Sgt. Espinoza of the use of force incident, even though 
Sgt. Espinoza’s body camera was continuously on during this time. [City Ex. 9-45] 
Charge 2 is SUSTAINED.  The Commission finds that based on a preponderance of evidence 
that Arone failed to immediately notify his supervisor of his use of force (knee strikes on Wilson) 
at the scene of the August 18, 2023 incident, in violation of City Police Department Policy 
300.5.1. 
CHARGE 3. 
Did Officer Arone violate City Police Department Policy 320.4.5(o) 
“disgraceful conduct” by making the statement to a suspect, “Play 
stupid games, win stupid prizes?” 
City Police Department Policy 320.4.5(o) describes “disgraceful conduct” as “Criminal, 
dishonest, infamous or disgraceful conduct adversely affecting the employee/employer 
relationship, whether on or off duty.” 
It is undisputed that Officer Arone made the statement, “Play stupid games, win stupid prizes” to 
Thomas Wilson in response to Wilson’s crying out, “you killed my brother.” Officer Arone 
regretted his statement as “insensitive and in bad taste,” and that his state of mind when he said 
it was “emotional shock” at Wilson “trying to play victim.” 
The Commission understands that the job of a police officer can be very stressful and that the 
police response to the incident which dispatch had identified as “attempted robbery” and 

379477.1
6 
“assault on a police officer” with shots fired, was emotionally charged, such that the use of 
profanity and potentially insensitive statements in response to suspects at a scene can occur.  
While the Commission does not agree that this statement would in and of itself support a 
decision to terminate, there is no dispute that the statement was made and that it was 
unprofessional.  The statement is not consistent with the P.O.S.T. standard of “community 
expectations,” which is that “Community members want to be treated with respect and dignity.  
The public expects peace officers to exercise their authority in order to maintain social order, 
manage conflicts and solve problems.”  [City Ex. 23, page 1-6]. 
Charge 3 is SUSTAINED.  The Commission finds that based on a preponderance of evidence 
Officer Arone made the statement alleged, and that such statement did violate City Police 
Department Policy 320.4.5(o). 
CHARGE 4: Did Officer Arone violate City Police Department Policies 320.4.5(aa) 
“Conduct unbecoming” and 320.4.5(o) “disgraceful conduct” when   
he agreed without question to remove and conceal knives carried by  
another officer from an active crime scene which was also an officer-  
 
 
involved shooting? 
In addition to City Police Department Policy 320.4.5(o) concerning “disgraceful conduct” 
(discussed above), Section 320.4.5(aa) defines “conduct unbecoming an officer” as “Any other 
on-duty or off-duty conduct which any employee knows or reasonably should know is 
unbecoming to a member of the Department which is contrary to good order, efficiency or 
morale, or which tends to reflect unfavorably upon the Department or its members.” 
The facts are undisputed that approximately 30 minutes after the use of force incident, Officer 
Arone was approached by Officer Bennett to “do me a favor.”  The body camera footage of 
Officer Arone showed Officer Bennett with his hands behind his back, walking over to Officer 
Arone and appearing to hand off something to him sideways and intentionally obscured from 
camera view.  Officer Arone testified both at the appeal hearing and at the Internal Affairs 
investigation that what Officer Bennett handed him was two knives which Bennett had on his 
person at the scene. Officer Arone did not question Officer Bennett about why he was handing 
him the knives or what he wanted Officer Arone to do with the knives. Officer Arone’s body 
camera, which was recording the entire incident, shows Officer Arone taking the knives (which 
remain obscured from camera) and walking to his patrol vehicle, removing a roll of crime scene 
tape which he holds over the items he took from Officer Bennett (remaining obscured from 
camera view) and then placing items into his beat bag in the back of the patrol car, where they 
remained concealed.  The items placed in the patrol bag are not visible on camera, but Officer 
Arone confirmed they were the knives given to him by Officer Bennett.  Officer Arone testified 
that he left the knives concealed in his patrol bag, in the back of the vehicle.  
When asked about why Officer Bennett asked him to take the knives, Officer Arone stated both 
at the appeal hearing and at the Internal Affairs investigation that the knives may have been out 
of policy, but he was not a “knife guy” [City Ex. 11-39, line 1706-1712] and would be speculating 
on Officer Bennett’s reason.   
Unbeknown to Officer Arone at the time, Officer Bennett was one of the officers who had fired 
his weapon at the scene.  Officer Bennett, however, would have known that he had fired his 
weapon at the scene, which triggers an officer-involved shooting investigation in which officers 
must not alter their uniform or equipment. And while Officer Arone testified in his interview with 
the Internal Affairs investigator from Chaplin & Hill that he did not know at the time of the 

379477.1
7 
incident that an officer in an officer-involved shooting must not alter their uniform or equipment 
[City Ex. 11-42], this statement is inconsistent with his testimony at the appeal hearing that he 
had previously been involved (albeit, not as a shooter) with five officer-involved shootings, and 
with his earlier testimony at the Internal Affairs investigation that he “thought all the shooters had 
been sequestered” at the time he took the knives from Officer Bennett.  [City Ex. 11-41, lines 
1794-1813].  Also, Officer Arone admitted before the Internal Affairs investigator that he realized 
at the time that it was likely a policy violation that Officer Bennett was attempting to conceal when 
he handed him the knives.  [City Ex. 11-43, lines 1897-1914; 11-45, lines 2005-2008]. 
Officer Arone’s explanation that Bennett’s policy violation “…in reality…wouldn’t have been a 
very big deal” [City Ex. 11-431913-1914] because Arone believed knives were not used at the 
scene and would not have been part of the body of evidence (for crime scene investigation) is 
not persuasive; nor is it within Officer Arone’s authority to determine what parts of a police policy 
should be obeyed and what parts are not a “very big deal.” 
Knowingly participating in an attempt to cover up a policy violation by another officer at a crime 
scene which is also an officer-involved shooting, certainly constitutes conduct unbecoming an 
officer, as well as “disgraceful conduct,” as defined by City Police Department Policy 320.45 
(aa) and (o). 
Charge 4 is SUSTAINED.  The Commission finds that based on a preponderance of evidence 
Officer Arone did remove and conceal knives given to him by another officer at an active crime 
scene, which was also an officer-involved shooting and that such conduct did violate City Police 
Department Policy 320.4.5(aa) “conduct unbecoming an officer” and (o) “disgraceful conduct.” 
REVIEW OF LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE 
Pursuant to Civil Service Rule 10.5(h), this Commission has the authority to uphold, modify or 
revoke the disciplinary action which is the subject of appeal; the action of the Commission shall 
be final. 
Police Chief White, a 20-year veteran of law enforcement including six years in a Police Chief 
role, with over 14 years of experience in reviewing and deciding discipline, explained his 
reasoning for concluding that he could not responsibly keep Arone on the police force after the 
August 18, 2023 Velvet Dispensary use of force incident and the failure to report it, given 
previous discipline and retraining for very similar conduct which had occurred six months 
previously.  This prior incident, which occurred on April 1, 2023 with sustained findings of 
violation of the use of force policy 300.5 and failure to report the use of force (violation of Policy 
300.5.1) was documented for purposes of prior personnel history and progressive discipline on 
the January 16, 2024 Notice of Discipline for the Velvet Dispensary incident. [City Ex. 1-4 and 5]. 
Although the completion of the investigation of the Amtrak April 1, 2023 use of force/failure to 
report use of force incident overlaps with the Velvet Dispensary August 18, 2023 incident and its 
resulting investigation, this chronology was clarified at the appeal hearing before the 
Commission: 
•
On April 1, 2023, Arone was dispatched to Amtrak station to respond to a citizen complaint
of a man (identified as “Wilkins”) loitering and refusing to leave.  Officer Arone made contact
with Wilkins first verbally and then when Wilkins refused to leave the Amtrak station area,

379477.1
8 
grabbed Wilkins by the shirt, pinned him to the ground, and put his knee on Wilkins’ chest. 
Wilkins was not arrested. Officer Arone did not report this use of force, nor had his body-
worn camera been activated during the encounter.   
•
The use of force incident came to the City’s attention as the result of a citizen complaint and
citizen witnesses, and as a result, Officer Arone was placed on paid administrative leave
and an Internal Affairs investigation was opened.
•
Sometime before June 2023, Chief White reviewed the transcript of Arone’s Internal Affairs
testimony and decided that termination would not be the proposed discipline and he ordered
Arone back to duty.
•
On June 8, 2023 Arone received additional training on the City Police Department Use of
Force Policy from Chief White.
•
August 18, 2023, the Velvet Dispensary incident occurred, which included an officer-
involved shooting, triggering an Internal Affairs investigation.
•
October 17, 2023, upon completion of the Amtrak incident Internal Affairs investigation,
Officer Arone was served with a Notice of Intent to discipline (30 days suspension was
proposed) for that use of force/failure to report incident.
•
November 29, 2023, Officer Arone was served with final discipline (reduction to 20 days
suspension without pay) for the April 1, 2023 Amtrak use of force/failure to report incident.
•
December 1, 2023, the Internal Affairs investigation of the August 18, 2023 Velvet
Dispensary incident was completed.
•
On December 26, 2023, Arone was served with the Notice of Intent to discipline (termination
proposed) for the Velvet Dispensary use of force incident, and other charges.
•
On January 16, 2024, Arone was served with Notice of Discipline (termination) for various
Police Department Policy violations at the August 18, 2023 Velvet Dispensary incident.
Police Chief White explained that during the pendency of the April 1, 2023 Amtrak incident 
investigation, he was “perplexed” about Officer Arone’s use of force, given that Arone was a 
defensive tactics instructor, but that after reviewing Officer Arone’s Internal Affairs transcript 
testimony sometime prior to June, 2023, he determined  Officer Arone’s use of force and failure 
to report it on April 1, 2023 would not result in termination, although the exact level of discipline 
could not be determined until the Internal Affairs investigation was completed.  In the meantime, 
Police Chief White returned Officer Arone to duty and provided retraining on the City Police 
Department Use of Force policy on June 8, 2023. Police Chief White testified that by retraining, 
he wanted Arone to have a chance to do better and wanted him to be successful.  Once the 
Internal Affairs investigation was concluded with sustained findings of violation of the use of 
force policy and failure to report the use of force, Arone was disciplined with 20 days of 
suspension without pay beginning in November 28-30, 2023. 
Regarding the level of discipline (termination) for the August 18, 2023 Velvet Dispensary 
incident, Police Chief White explained that he could not see any other result but termination, 
given the sustained findings of several policy violations—the same kind of violations previously 
sustained against Officer Arone only six months earlier in the Amtrak incident, and with having 
also been retrained on the use of force two months previously.  Police Chief White stated that it 
is not his job to act punitively and he was not “mad” at Arone, but he cannot have an officer on 
the force who does not follow policies which impact the community he serves. 
The Commission acknowledges the difficulty a Police Officer may experience in making snap 
decisions during a response to a law enforcement incident, and appreciates the hard and often 

dangerous work the Martinez Police Department and its members do to protect the community
they serve. The Commission also wishes to thank the veterans of the U.S. armed forces for
their service, several of whom (including the Appellant) participated in this appeal hearing.

The job of the Police Chief in determining the proper level of discipline for sustained finding of
violations of several City Police Department Policies, including, but not limited to use of force, is
not easy nor taken lightly by this Commission; however, the community is entitled to peace
officers who promote the trust of the community and who act in a way to maintain that trust.
This means an officer must be relied upon to follow the Police Department Policies at all times,
even when no one is watching. Accordingly, Police Chief White’s termination of Officer Arone
for sustained violations of City Police Department Policies 300.3 (use of force), 300.5.1
(“‘immediately” reporting use of force), 320.4.5(aa) (conduct unbecoming) and (0) (disgraceful
conduct) during his response to the August 18, 2023 Velvet Dispensary incident and crime
scene was reasonable and warranted and is therefore, upheld by the Commission.

APPELLANT’S APPEAL OF HIS TERMINATION IS DENIED. Pursuant Civil Service Rule
10.5(h), this decision is final and binding on the parties.

Fatal Officer-Involved Incident

PREAMBLE 
 
This was a fatal officer-involved shooting by officers from the Fontana Police Department. 
The shooting was investigated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. This 
factual summary is based on a thorough review of all the investigative reports, 
photographs, video, and audio recordings submitted by the San Bernardino County 
Sheriff’s Department. 
 
FACTUAL SUMMARY 
 
On the afternoon of August 15, 2023, around 3:50 p.m., Alejandro Diaz stormed onto the 
Sierra Lakes Golf Course, shouting, and brandishing a black handgun. Sweating 
profusely and visibly agitated, Diaz waved the gun around, causing golfers to run and 
hide. Employees rushed inside the clubhouse and locked the doors. 
 
At 3:54 p.m., multiple witnesses at the golf course began calling 911 for assistance. As 
the 911 calls came in, police were already on their way. Just six minutes earlier, Witness 
#1 had called 911 to report her husband, Alejandro Diaz, an off-duty Los Angeles County 
Sheriff’s Deputy, was experiencing some sort of breakdown, had shot a gun inside their 
home, and had left the residence on foot, armed with two handguns. The Diaz residence 
was located within the Sierra Lakes Golf Course community in Fontana, only two-tenths 
a mile from the clubhouse. Witness #1, clearly in great distress, told the 911 operator that 
she did not know where Diaz had gone.  
 
Fontana Police Sergeant Brian McLane, in his patrol unit near the scene, listened to 
Witness #1’s 911 call on his unit’s Live911 system and immediately headed for the golf 
course. As did Corporal David Campa and Officer Casey Mutter. Officer Leonard Sein 
and his trainee Officer Tyrell Jones were taking a theft report at a nearby store when they 
heard the triple tone, alerting all officers to an emergency in progress, over their unit radio. 
Breaking from the theft call, Officers Sein and Jones quickly headed for the golf course. 
 
As the officers made their way to the course, they learned that multiple 911 callers were 
reporting a man with a gun was at the Sierra Lakes Golf Course. Fearing they were about 
to have an active shooter at the golf course, the officers raced to the scene. Several 
witnesses reported the man with a gun was near “the starter,” or hole one, which the 
officers believed was near the clubhouse. The officers arrived at the course within 
minutes, stopping their units near the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, 
and Officer Mutter grabbed their patrol rifles and headed on foot for the putting green in 
front of the clubhouse in search of Diaz. Officers Sein and Jones quickly caught up, 
running to join their partners. The officers promptly spotted Diaz about 40 yards away 
beside a golf cart parked on the cart path that ran along the putting green in front of the 
clubhouse.

Diaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts and matched the description given by Witness #1 
and the witnesses at the golf course. Sergeant McLane noted that Diaz was so drenched 
in sweat that it looked like someone had poured water on him. Confident this was the man 
they were looking for, the officers immediately ordered Diaz to show his hands and not to 
reach for anything as they moved in his direction. On his knees beside the golf cart, Diaz 
looked at the officers and raised his left hand but kept his right hand down near his side, 
hidden from view.  
 
The five officers quickly and cautiously moved across the putting green toward Diaz, 
fanning out from one another and forming a half-circle between Diaz and the clubhouse. 
The officers repeatedly commanded Diaz to keep his hands up and not to reach for 
anything, but Diaz kept his right hand down by his side, hidden from the officers’ view. 
The clubhouse was situated directly behind the officers as they moved across the putting 
green toward Diaz. Inside the clubhouse, frightened patrons and employees watched the 
situation unfold. Diaz remained on his knees, facing the officers. As the officers moved in 
closer, they saw Diaz reaching around on the ground behind his body, as if trying to find 
something. Believing Diaz was reaching for a gun, the officers told him repeatedly, “Don’t 
do it!” 
 
Diaz suddenly moved from a kneeling position down onto his side and reclined backward, 
still reaching with his right hand for something on the ground behind him. Officer Jones 
was close enough to see the black handgun on the ground near Diaz, but the other 
officers did not see the gun until Diaz sat up, holding it in his right hand. Diaz pointed the 
gun at the officers, prompting them to fire their weapons in response. Diaz was struck by 
gunfire and began falling backward, discharging his handgun into the air before falling 
onto his back and dropping the gun. No officers or civilians were hit by gunfire. 
Immediately after the shooting, Officer Sein radioed “shots fired” and requested medical 
aid at 3:58 p.m. The officers quickly approached Diaz, disarmed him, and began 
rendering aid. Diaz was transported to the hospital, where he later succumbed to his 
injuries and was pronounced deceased at 4:52 p.m.

On August 29, 2023, at approximately 1:22 p.m., Sergeant Brian McLane was 
interviewed by Detectives Nicholas Paslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County 
Sheriff’s Department. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Sergeant McLane was on duty as a patrol sergeant for the day shift 
patrol team. Sergeant McLane’s marked patrol unit was equipped with a program called 
Live911 which allowed him to listen to 911 calls as they were received by dispatch. The 
 
2 Each involved officer individually marked his position relative to Diaz at the time of the shooting on a separate map 
page. During the shooting, the officers stood several feet apart from each other on the putting green. As such, the 
officers’ markings were substantially similar.

ability to listen to the 911 calls afforded supervising officers with the ability to manage and 
distribute resources before the call was entered into the system for the patrol units. While 
on patrol, Sergeant McLane always had the Live911 program running so he could listen 
to the 911 calls as they were received. Based on his experience, the Live911 program 
has about a three to seven second delay. Having listened to multiple calls since the 
program’s inception, Sergeant McLane has learned to discern which calls may require 
the attention of a supervisor as opposed to the calls that require just a standard response 
from patrol officers. 
 
On August 15, 2024, at about 3:30 p.m., Sergeant McLane was in his patrol unit on 
Palmetto Avenue, just south of Baseline Road. Sergeant McLane heard a 911 call come 
in over the Live911 system. The caller was a female (later determined to be Witness #1) 
and as she spoke to the dispatcher, Sergeant McLane noted Witness #1 had difficulty 
communicating and seemed very emotional. As the dispatcher tried to elicit more 
information, Witness #1 was unable to answer simple questions quickly with good 
information. Because Witness #1 seemed to have a hard time communicating what had 
happened, Sergeant McLane believed Witness #1 was emotionally overwhelmed. 
Sergeant McLane heard Witness #1 say something about, “There was a gunshot that had 
happened in the house.” Upon hearing that a gun had been fired in the residence, 
Sergeant McLane began heading toward the house. Sergeant McLane heard the “triple 
tone” go out over their primary channel. The triple tone is used to put all officers on notice 
when a call requiring law enforcement response is dangerous, for instance, gunshots 
being fired or a felony crime in progress. 
 
Sergeant McLane turned his unit radio down to focus on the Live911 system so he could 
hear the 911 call between Witness #1 and the dispatcher as it developed in “real-time.” 
As he drove to the house, Sergeant McLane heard the dispatcher ask Witness #1 if it was 
her husband who had fired the shot and whether the shot was fired intentionally at her or 
at the wall. Witness #1 was unable to answer the dispatcher’s question and replied 
something to the effect of, “Well, I hope it was intentionally at the wall.” Witness #1 
reported that her husband (later identified as Alejandro Diaz) was “off-duty and that his 
gun was his duty weapon.” 
 
Sergeant McLane quickened his response to the location, activating his lights and sirens 
to get around traffic when he came upon it. As Sergeant McLane reached an intersection 
at Sierra Lakes Parkway, he heard Witness #1 say that Diaz had left the house on foot, 
armed with two handguns. Sergeant McLane could see that the 911 call had originated 
from a house just north of Sierra Lakes Golf Club and confirmed this information with 
dispatch. Sergeant McLane believed that the “path of least travel” for Diaz was to go 
straight south to the golf course. Sergeant McLane knew he would drive past the golf 
course on his way to the Diaz residence, so when he got to Clubhouse Drive, he turned 
west and headed toward the golf course. Sergeant McLane got to the intersection of 
Augusta Drive and Clubhouse Drive, which was right before the start of the golf course.

Sergeant McLane advised over his police radio that he was “97 in the area”3 and would 
be standing by at Augusta and Clubhouse for more information. Sergeant McLane knew 
additional officers were responding to the location, so he staged at that intersection.  
 
Sergeant McLane’s thinking was, “We’ve got a man who was involved in some type of 
domestic incident that rose to the level of at least one gunshot being fired inside the 
property, the female who is clearly confused and in an emotionally heightened state and 
not really able to articulate answers to simple questions that the dispatcher is asking,” 
and Sergeant McLane was concerned that even though Witness #1 said Diaz had fired 
into a wall, there was a possibility that someone in the house might have been injured. 
However, given the fact that Diaz had left the residence on foot and was armed with two 
handguns, Sergeant McLane was also concerned about the fact that Diaz was now in an 
open area which was heavily populated by people on the golf course and the golf club 
parking lot. Familiar with the area around the golf course, Sergeant McLane knew it was 
always packed at that time of day. Because of this, Sergeant McLane wanted to wait there 
for additional resources. Additionally, Sergeant McLane did not want to pass by Diaz while 
driving his marked police unit and push Diaz into a hiding spot. Sergeant McLane turned 
his unit radio back up and heard the dispatcher say they were now receiving multiple 911 
calls about a man with a gun at the golf course and the golf clubhouse. Sergeant McLane 
looked at his screen and saw all the 911 calls populating regarding a man with a gun at 
the golf course. 
 
At this point, Sergeant McLane’s prevailing thought was that they had an active shooter 
situation unfolding. Sergeant McLane thought, “We’ve got a guy who’s already willing to 
shoot, possibly injure somebody at his house,” and “now, he’s put himself into a populated 
area that is wide open, armed with two handguns.” Based on Sergeant McLane’s training 
and experience, he knew that public places with soft security were common targets for 
active shooter engagements. Sergeant McLane knew that civilians enjoying recreation at 
the golf course would not be “in a condition mentally to defend themselves, physically 
defend themselves, if they’re just there for downtime, and this guy comes around with a 
handgun.”  
 
Sergeant McLane started driving slowly, heading westbound on Clubhouse Drive toward 
the clubhouse. The golf course was on the north side of the street, so Sergeant McLane 
drove slowly to ensure he didn’t pass by Diaz without seeing him. Sergeant McLane 
unlocked his MP5 rifle from the unit lock and placed it on his lap so he could respond 
more quickly if he started being shot at while he drove. 
 
Sergeant McLane saw a man wearing a maroon shirt and black shorts in the distance at 
the “start of the golf course,” which was down the street from the location from which the 
original 911 call had originated. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz had been described as 
wearing a gray shirt and black shorts but asked the dispatcher to verify Diaz’s description. 
While waiting for dispatch to reply, Sergeant McLane watched the man in the maroon

shirt. Dispatch advised that Diaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts. Based on this 
description and the behavior of the man in the maroon shirt, Sergeant McLane ruled the 
man out as the suspect.  
 
Sergeant McLane drove into the golf course parking lot but did not park directly in front of 
the clubhouse because he didn’t know where Diaz was. Dispatch had advised that the 
911 callers were saying the man with a gun was near “the starter.” Sergeant McLane did 
not know what “the starter” was but believed it was probably “hole one or near hole one,” 
which Sergeant McLane surmised was near the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane got out of 
his unit and slung his MP5 onto his body to secure it. Concerned about an active shooter 
situation, Sergeant McLane’s goal was to find Diaz and draw Diaz’s attention toward 
himself. Sergeant McLane believed that drawing Diaz’s attention to himself would ensure 
that Diaz would not be focused on golfers, staff, and any other nearby civilians. 
Residences surrounded the golf course, so Sergeant McLane was also concerned about 
Diaz making it to one of the houses. Sergeant McLane wanted to draw Diaz’s attention to 
establish communication with him.  
 
Corporal Campa and Officer Mutter arrived at the golf course parking lot and met up with 
Sergeant McLane as he exited his vehicle. Over the radio, Sergeant McLane asked for 
air support and advised that he, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter were ""deploying on 
foot."" Sergeant McLane believed air support was critical because they did not know where 
Diaz was. The officers started walking down a walkway west of the clubhouse, which led 
to a putting green. A split second after they began walking, Officers Sein and Jones 
arrived and joined Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter. Sergeant 
McLane had worked with the officers, both as a peer and as a supervisor. Sergeant 
McLane had attended multiple ""movement trainings, active shooter trainings, range 
trainings, and de-escalation trainings"" with the officers. He was confident the team did not 
need to verbalize their plan, which was to go out to approach Diaz on foot and try to 
establish communication. 
 
The team of officers walked along the walkway toward the putting green. There was a 
“huge open area” to the officers’ left, front, and right. Sergeant McLane saw golfers or 
staff to their north and west, down on the other side of a tree line. A golf cart was parked 
beside the putting green just before the tree line. Sergeant McLane saw Diaz wearing 
black shorts and a light gray shirt beside the golf cart. Diaz’s light gray shirt had a dark 
U-shaped sweat line over the chest, up toward his shoulders, and around his neck. The 
sweat line was so dark that it looked like someone had poured water onto it or like 
someone’s shirt would look after a very intense workout. Based on Diaz’s appearance, 
combined with the statements given during the 911 call, Sergeant McLane believed Diaz 
was experiencing “some type of manic physical response to reality,” whether it was fueled 
by alcohol, drugs, or lack of sleep, Sergeant McLane did not know. Sergeant McLane was 
confident this was the man who had reportedly left his house armed with two guns. 
Sergeant McLane did not initially see anything in Diaz’s hands.

Sergeant McLane estimated Diaz was 40 yards away. There was nothing between Diaz 
and the officers as they approached him, so there was no cover or concealment where 
the officers could stop and try to communicate to Diaz from a position of safety. Sergeant 
McLane knew they had to get closer to Diaz to draw his attention to them and establish 
communication. The goal was to talk to Diaz, to try to de-escalate the situation to a point 
where they could detain Diaz and conduct a criminal investigation or a mental health 
evaluation.  
 
Sergeant McLane told his partners that he saw Diaz right ahead of them, and they 
continued walking down toward Diaz, closing the distance. The officers did not run toward 
Diaz but made a tactical approach, walking toward Diaz at a “nice, smooth, comfortable” 
pace. As they neared Diaz, Sergeant McLane said, “Hey man, hey bro, show me your 
hands. Let me see your hands.” Sergeant McLane repeated this multiple times. The other 
officers gave similar commands, and there was no panic, yelling, or vulgarity involved.  
 
Diaz was standing near the rear passenger side of the golf cart. Diaz was facing the golf 
cart and was “just moving around.” Diaz’s “actions did not make a whole lot of sense or 
have any productive reasoning to them” as far as Sergeant McLane could decipher. When 
Sergeant McLane first started trying to communicate with Diaz, Diaz looked his way and 
made eye contact with him. Sergeant McLane was hopeful that they would be able to 
establish a positive line of communication. However, Diaz quickly “looked away and went 
back to these, these movements around his golf cart.” Because Diaz was moving his 
hands around, they were not always in view, which meant Sergeant McLane couldn’t 
always see them.  
 
As the officers approached, Diaz turned away and went down to his knees. Diaz’s left 
side faced toward Sergeant McLane. Diaz’s elbows were bent and pointed to the ground 
and his hands were up by his head. Sergeant McLane thought Diaz was hearing what the 
officers were saying to him because he was in a submissive position that would allow the 
officers to safely detain Diaz. However, that was “very short lived,” because Diaz put his 
hands down onto the grass. Sergeant McLane still did not see a gun, but then the next 
moment, Diaz had a gun in his right hand. Sergeant McLane thought, “Fuck, he’s got a 
gun!” Sergeant McLane did not know where the gun came from, whether it came from the 
golf cart or somewhere on the ground. Sergeant McLane held his MP5 rifle at the low 
ready position, level with his chin, and wasn’t looking through the rifle’s sight up until that 
point. 
 
When Diaz grabbed the gun, Sergeant McLane heard his partners giving verbal 
commands to the effect of, “Show us your hands! Don’t do it!” Sergeant McLane briefly 
stopped when he saw Diaz with the gun, assessed the situation, and then continued 
moving forward. Diaz was on his knees with the gun in his right hand as he turned to face 
Sergeant McLane. When Sergeant McLane saw Diaz with the gun, he focused on Diaz’s 
gun because he realized that the threat to his life and the lives of his partners was 
elevated. Sergeant McLane brought up his rifle and pointed it at Diaz’s center of mass.

Diaz faced Sergeant McLane and rolled to his left side with the gun in his right hand. 
Diaz’s gun was initially down, with Diaz’s “palm facing down as he held it toward the 
putting green,” but then Diaz brought the gun up and pointed it right at Sergeant McLane. 
As soon as Diaz raised the gun, Sergeant McLane saw the muzzle of the gun pointed 
right at him. Even though the gun was pointed at Sergeant McLane, Sergeant McLane’s 
partners were right next to him. When Sergeant McLane saw the muzzle of Diaz’s gun 
pointed right at him, he realized the threat to his and his partners’ lives was imminent. 
Sergeant McLane’s fear was “through the roof.” Sergeant McLane fired two rounds in 
quick succession at Diaz to stop the threat he posed to his life and the lives of his partners. 
Sergeant McLane estimated he was 10 to 15 yards away from Diaz when he fired and 
believed he was the first officer in the group to fire at Diaz. Sergeant McLane side-stepped 
to his left as he fired and heard other officers’ gunfire. Sergeant McLane saw several 
rounds hitting the grass around where Diaz sat. Sergeant McLane saw Diaz’s gun “go up 
to the air and then the next thing” that Sergeant McLane remembered as he sidestepped 
to the left, Diaz’s gun had fallen and was “now right underneath his arm.” Sergeant 
McLane did not see Diaz fire his handgun. 
 
When Sergeant McLane saw Diaz’s gun fall to the ground, he told his partners to “cease 
fire” or to stop firing. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz was still a threat because he could 
see the gun beneath Diaz’s arm, but with the gun no longer pointed at the officers, the 
threat was no longer imminent. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz had been struck by 
gunfire because Diaz was lying on his back with his arms bent and his hands by his head. 
Sergeant McLane kept his eyes locked on the gun as he and the other officers quickly 
approached Diaz. Sergeant McLane grabbed the handgun Diaz had pointed at him and 
moved it a few feet away so that it was out of Diaz’s reach. 
 
Sergeant McLane knew he and the officers needed to provide medical aid to Diaz. Diaz 
was positioned partly on the putting green and partly on the cart path. Sergeant McLane 
grabbed Diaz’s arms and another officer grabbed Diaz’s legs and they moved Diaz onto 
the putting green so they would have a solid foundation to render medical care. As they 
began assessing Diaz for injuries, Sergeant McLane requested medical aid come to the 
scene. While waiting for paramedics, the officers rendered medical aid.  
 
Diaz had an empty holster on the waistband of his shorts, but Sergeant McLane never 
saw a second gun and did not know where the second gun was located. Sergeant McLane 
and the other shooting officers were transitioned away from the scene, relieved by other 
uninvolved officers. Sergeant McLane estimated only a minute and a half had passed 
between the time he stepped out of his patrol until the officers began rendering aid after 
officer-involved shooting. 
 
On August 29, 2023, Corporal David Campa was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas 
Paslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

On August 15, 2023, Corporal Campa was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. 
Corporal Campa’s patrol unit was equipped with the Live911 system which allowed him 
to listen to 911 calls when they came into their dispatch center. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., 
Corporal Campa listened to a 911 call placed by a female who was screaming and out of 
breath. Corporal Campa thought the call was “out of the ordinary” because the female 
sounded like she was scared and in distress. The Live911 system provided a “geo map” 
showing the area from which the call had been placed. Upon seeing the call had 
originated from the Sierra Lakes area, Corporal Campa began driving to the location. 
While driving to the location, Corporal Campa heard the female say that her husband had 
shot into the wall. The caller was not answering all of the dispatcher’s questions, which 
Corporal Campa attributed to her being in shock or distress. The dispatcher asked the 
caller if her husband had shot at the wall “on purpose,” and she answered, “I don’t know. 
I hope so.” Corporal Campa thought “somebody’s life was in danger” because a rational 
person would not shoot a gun in their house. The female caller described her husband as 
wearing a gray shirt and black shorts and advised he had left the residence. Either the 
female caller or her son told dispatch that Diaz was armed with two guns when he left the 
residence.4 The caller advised that her husband was a deputy with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff’s Department. Upon learning that Diaz was a law enforcement officer, 
Corporal Campa knew that Diaz was well trained, would know police tactics, and would 
therefore know the officers’ tactics as they encountered him. 
 
Corporal Campa and Officer Mutter were dispatched to the location; Sergeant McLane 
advised he was en route as well. As Corporal Campa drove down Clubhouse Drive, he 
saw Sergeant McLane staged near the scene at Sierra Lakes Golf Course, waiting for 
additional officers to arrive. Corporal Campa heard dispatch advise that several parties 
were reporting there was a man with a gun at Sierra Lakes Golf Course near hole number 
one. Corporal Campa thought, “Okay, this guy, he has some type of domestic argument 
with his wife. He shot a round in the house, at least one round that I know of. He’s armed 
with two guns. Now he ran, drove, I don’t know how he got there, but he’s at the Sierra 
Lakes Golf Course, and you’ve got multiple people calling saying he’s armed with a gun.”  
 
Corporal Campa feared they had an active shooter situation because Diaz had fired a  
gun in his house, had left the residence while armed with two handguns, and now there 
were multiple parties at the golf course reporting a man with a gun. Recognizing that 
people’s lives were in danger, Corporal Campa knew they had to find Diaz. Corporal 
Campa’s goal was to contact Diaz to detain or arrest him and conduct an investigation to 
determine what if any, crime he committed. 
 
Corporal Campa and Sergeant McLane drove to the main entrance at the front of the 
clubhouse. Several cars were parked in the golf course parking lot, so Corporal Campa 
knew several people were present at the golf course. Corporal Campa parked his unit 
and retrieved his department-issued Colt M4 patrol rifle from the trunk, racking a round 
into the chamber. Corporal Campa retrieved his rifle because he knew they might 
 
4 Corporal Campa could not recall which party told the dispatcher this.

encounter Diaz from 100 yards away on the golf course, which was essentially an open 
field. The rifle would better equip Corporal Campa if he needed to defend his life, his 
partners’ lives, or the lives of citizens from that distance. 
 
Sergeant McLane called for 40-King, the Sheriff’s helicopter, to assist in locating Diaz. 
Corporal Campa knew they did not have “the comfort to wait and see” whether Diaz 
started shooting people. With lives in danger, Corporal Campa knew they needed to find 
Diaz immediately. Officer Mutter joined Corporal Campa and Sergeant McLane as they 
began walking from the parking lot toward the golf course. Officer Sein and his trainee, 
Officer Jones, caught up shortly after. As the officers approached the course, Corporal 
Campa saw a small cart path west of the clubhouse’s front entrance, which Corporal 
Campa believed led to hole one. Corporal Campa saw two golf carts on the cart path, 
about 30 to 40 yards away. Corporal Campa noticed a man wearing a gray shirt and black 
shorts, matching the description given by the 911 caller, sitting down near the two golf 
carts. 
 
As they walked past the main clubhouse, Officer Campa saw people standing at the 
clubhouse. Corporal Campa yelled at them, ""Where's he at?"" The people pointed toward 
the man (later identified as Diaz) sitting near the golf carts. As the officers approached 
Diaz, Corporal Campa saw three to four golfers in the distance to the north. Seeing the 
golfers so far away from their golf carts was strange, and Corporal Campa thought, 
""Something's going on here."" Corporal Campa was not sure whether Diaz had tried to kill 
his wife, but until the officers had a chance to speak with her, they did not know whether 
Diaz had shot at the wall or tried to kill her. As the officers made their approach, Diaz 
started ""yelling something toward"" the officers and pointed to his west ""saying something 
like, 'Hey, he's over there, he's over there.'"" Corporal Campa knew something was not 
adding up because everyone at the clubhouse was saying that Diaz was the man with the 
gun. Corporal Campa believed Diaz was trying to lure the officers into an ambush to kill 
them. Corporal Campa held his rifle at the low-ready, looking at Diaz over the top of his 
optic sights as they approached from a distance. Corporal Campa began looking at Diaz 
through his rifle's sights as he got closer to Diaz. 
 
When the officers were about 20 yards away from Diaz, they began giving Diaz 
commands to show his hands. Diaz was sitting down, facing the officers with his legs 
extended forward. Diaz had his right hand behind his back, out of view. Sergeant McLane 
was positioned to the right of Corporal Campa. Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein were to 
the right of Sergeant McLane, but Corporal Campa did not recall in which order they 
stood. The officers gave Diaz multiple commands to show his hands and told Diaz, “Don’t 
do it.” Diaz acknowledged the officers by lifting his left hand upward. Corporal Campa 
saw Diaz’s left palm but could not see his right hand. As the officers neared Diaz, Corporal 
Campa heard what he believed, based on his training and experience, was a gun falling 
to the ground. Corporal Campa did not see a firearm near Diaz but could see that Diaz 
was moving his right arm, which he kept concealed from the officers. Corporal Campa 
believed that everyone stopped their approach toward Diaz at this point. Diaz was not

listening to their commands and was concealing his right hand from their view. Corporal 
Campa and his partners were in front of Diaz without cover or concealment. 
 
Corporal Campa believed Diaz had a gun and feared Diaz was going to shoot the officers. 
Diaz then leaned to his right side, reclining backward at a downward angle, and turned 
back to face the officers. When Diaz turned toward the officers, Corporal Campa saw a 
black semi-automatic handgun in Diaz’s right hand. Diaz started “wheeling” the gun 
toward the officers. When Diaz pointed the gun directly at the officers, Corporal Campa 
had no doubt Diaz intended to kill him and his partners. Fearing that he and his partners 
were going to die, Corporal Campa fired several rounds from his rifle at Diaz to stop his 
attack. Corporal Campa aimed for Diaz’s center mass area and estimated he fired “four 
to six rounds, maybe give or take one or two,” in quick succession from a distance of 15 
yards. As Corporal Campa fired, in his periphery, he saw Sergeant McLane also shooting. 
Corporal Campa knew his partners had also fired but did not know how many rounds they 
fired. 
 
The officers immediately approached Diaz, who had fallen onto the pathway/curb area. 
The officers moved Diaz onto the grass, where they administered aid to him until medics 
arrived and took over Diaz’s care. 
 
On August 30, 2023, Officer Casey Mutter was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas 
Paslak and Francisco Demara of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Officer Mutter was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. Officer 
Mutter’s patrol unit was equipped with the Live911 system, which allowed him to listen to 
911 calls when they came into their dispatch center. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., Officer 
Mutter was sitting in his patrol unit behind Home Depot on Sierra Lakes Parkway and 
Citrus Avenue, preparing to make a phone call when he received a message on his 
computer from dispatch. Dispatch asked Officer Mutter to listen to a live 911 call.  
 
Officer Mutter tuned into the 911 call and heard a female caller who sounded out of breath 
and scared. The caller stated that her husband had shot the wall inside their house. The 
dispatcher began asking the caller if she and her husband were arguing or if the shooting 
was accidental. The caller was “not forthcoming with a lot of information.” When the 
dispatcher asked if the shooting was accidental, the caller said she thought it was but 
wasn’t sure. Officer Mutter believed there was “something more going on,” likely a 
domestic dispute, and that the shooting was more than “just an accidental discharge in 
the house.” 
 
Still listening to the 911 call, Officer Mutter began driving quickly toward the 911 caller’s 
residence north of Sierra Lakes Golf Club. When Officer Mutter heard the caller say that 
her husband (later identified as Diaz) had left the residence, he slowed down because he 
believed there was no longer an immediate threat. Officer Mutter was close to the 
residence and wanted to ascertain where his backing officers were because he did not

want to drive up to the house alone and find an armed suspect in a potential domestic 
dispute who had already fired a round inside the house waiting for him outside the home. 
 
While Officer Mutter was driving north on Medinah Street, approaching Clubhouse Drive, 
dispatch advised they were receiving calls that there was a man (later identified as Diaz) 
armed with a gun on the golf course. Familiar with the golf course, Officer Mutter knew it 
was common for people to be there at that time of day. Recognizing the danger to the 
public and the potential for 30, 40, or 50 victims at the golf course, Officer Mutter 
immediately turned onto Clubhouse Drive and went directly to the golf course. As he drove 
into the golf course parking lot, Officer Mutter saw approximately 30 to 40 cars parked 
there. Based on this, Officer Mutter knew people were present at the golf course, and his 
main goal was to get in between them and Diaz. Officer Mutter estimated it took him about 
two to two and a half minutes to get to the golf course from the Home Depot parking lot. 
Diaz’s home was north of the clubhouse, so Officer Mutter parked on the eastern side of 
the clubhouse, hoping to cut Diaz off if he was walking toward the clubhouse.5 Officer 
Mutter grabbed his patrol rifle, got out his unit, and chambered a round. Officer Mutter 
chose his rifle because he believed it was the best weapon to have should he need to 
“take action at a distance” against someone armed with a handgun. 
 
Dispatch advised that witnesses were reporting the armed man was near the starting 
point of the course. Having previously golfed at the Sierra Lakes Golf course, Officer 
Mutter knew the starting point would be closer to hole one on the south side of the 
clubhouse. Officer Mutter walked to the south side of the clubhouse, where he met 
Sergeant McLane, who had just arrived, along with Corporal Campa. When Officer Mutter 
met up with Sergeant McLane, he learned through dispatch that Diaz was reportedly 
armed with two guns.6  
 
Officer Mutter heard over the radio that a BearCat (Fontana Police Department’s large, 
armored vehicle) and the Sheriff’s helicopter had been called to respond to the golf 
course. Multiple callers were reporting a man was waving a gun around at the golf course. 
Based on his training and experience, Officer Mutter knew that public places with soft 
security were common targets for active shooter situations. Officer Mutter did not know 
what Diaz’s intentions were, but he knew they needed to quickly contain Diaz to prevent 
him from becoming an active shooter. Because of this, the officers did not have time to 
formulate a plan. However, Officer Mutter had worked with Sergeant McLane and Officer 
Campa for several years and knew, based on their collective training and experience, that 
they all recognized the need to immediately locate Diaz and contain him to prevent him 
from harming anyone.  
 
 
5 As shown on Google Maps, there was no parking lot on the north side of the clubhouse; the parking lots were located 
south and east of the clubhouse. 
6 Officer Mutter did not learn that Diaz was an off-duty Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy until after the officer-
involved shooting.

As the officers walked toward the golf course, Officer Mutter saw golfers running north on 
the driving range, which brought Officer Mutter's attention just to the left, where he saw 
two golf carts and Diaz on the pathway at the starting point area for hole one. Diaz was 
about 35 to 40 yards away from the officers. Diaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts, 
matching the description given by witnesses. Diaz's shirt was drenched in sweat. Diaz 
stood at the back of one of the golf carts and looked like he was trying to blend in as a 
golfer, rummaging as if he was getting something out of a bag on the back of the golf cart. 
Diaz pointed his arm southward toward a thick tree line, and Officer Mutter heard Diaz 
say there was someone with a gun in the bushes. It wasn't easy to see anything beyond 
the trees. Officer Mutter believed Diaz was trying to ""bait"" the officers in to get them closer 
and to divert their attention away from himself so ""he could try to kill one of us.""   
 
Sergeant McLane began giving commands to Diaz to get down and to put his hands up. 
Diaz turned toward the officers, fell to his knees, and put his hands in the air. Officer 
Mutter felt a brief sense of relief because it appeared Diaz would surrender peacefully, 
and no one would get hurt. The officers walked along the ramp in front of the clubhouse, 
continuing their approach toward Diaz. Officer Mutter saw several people standing behind 
the pillars at the front of the clubhouse. To Officer Mutter’s left were Officer Campa and 
Sergeant McLane. The officers fanned out, getting in between Diaz and the clubhouse. 
Officer Mutter wanted to get between Diaz and the clubhouse because he did not know 
Diaz’s intentions. Officer Mutter saw that Officers Stein and Jones had joined the officers 
on the green as they approached Diaz.  
 
To reach Diaz, the officers had to traverse a large putting green. There was no cover or 
concealment between Diaz and the officers. Officer Mutter held his rifle at the high-ready 
position, pointed to Diaz, and looked over his optics as they walked toward Diaz. The 
officers continued giving Diaz commands. Diaz dropped his right hand down to his side, 
out of Officer Mutter’s view, and lowered his left hand, parallel with his shoulder, as if he 
was “complying with that one arm having it in the air, but in the meantime, his right hand 
was down moving around” out of Officer Mutter’s view. Officer Mutter ordered Diaz to 
“stop reaching, stop reaching, don’t grab it.” Sergeant McLane was also giving Diaz 
commands, so Officer Mutter stopped giving commands to avoid confusing Diaz. 
 
Still on his knees, Diaz then “kind of like almost falls to his right side and onto the ground, 
like he’s kind of laying on his elbow,” still facing toward the officers. Diaz’s left hand was 
still up, but his right hand was out of sight and appeared to be reaching for something on 
the ground. Officer Mutter could not see what Diaz was reaching for, but based on the 
information he had received, he believed Diaz was reaching for a gun. Officer Mutter told 
Diaz, “Don’t reach, don’t reach!” Diaz turned from a side laying position onto his buttocks 
and back, and then Officer Mutter saw Diaz’s right hand come up holding a black semi-
automatic handgun. Diaz swung the handgun over and pointed it at Officer Mutter. Officer 
Mutter was terrified and thought, “This guy’s gonna shoot out with me; he wants to kill 
me.” To stop the threat posed by Diaz, Officer Mutter fired his rifle at Diaz, who was 15 to 
20 yards away, aiming for his center mass/torso area. Officer Mutter fired in rapid

succession and believed he fired five to seven rounds in a southwest direction. Officer 
Mutter stopped firing when Diaz fell onto his back with his arms out to the side of his body 
and was no longer pointing a gun at him.  
 
The officers approached Diaz. Officer Mutter saw that Diaz’s black handgun was lying on 
the green next to Diaz, so he kept his rifle pointed at Diaz until he was confident Diaz was 
no longer able to pick the gun back up to shoot the officers. Diaz had fallen onto the 
ground at the curb line of the cart path, so Sergeant McLane and another officer moved 
Diaz onto the grass, where they began administering medical assistance. The officers 
immediately called for medical aid to respond. Officer Mutter saw a second gun in Diaz’s 
pocket. While officers tended to Diaz’s injuries, Officer Mutter checked downrange from 
where the officers had fired to make sure no one had been hurt, and no houses had been 
hit by gunfire. Officer Mutter walked back to the scene and saw additional officers had 
arrived. Officer Mutter told the officers about the golfers he had seen running north 
through the driving range because he knew they had probably witnessed what had 
happened. Officer Mutter then waited in the parking lot to be transported back to the police 
station. 
 
On August 30, 2023, Officer Tyrell Jones was interviewed by Detectives Francisco 
Demara and Nicholas Paslak of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Officer Jones was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. Officer 
Jones had been a police officer for eight weeks and was in field training. Officer Jones’ 
field training officer was Officer Leonard Sein, who rode along with him in the patrol unit.  
 
Officers Jones and Sein were handling a theft call at Kohl’s on Summit Avenue, north of 
the 210 freeway in Fontana, when dispatch aired a call for service regarding a male who 
had fired two gunshots inside a residence at the Sierra Lakes Golf Course.7 Officer Jones 
was not familiar with the area but was assisted by Officer Sein. Officer Jones activated 
his patrol unit’s lights and sirens and headed to the location. While driving to the golf 
course, Officer Jones listened to dispatch as it updated details regarding the call for 
service. Dispatch advised that the male had left the residence with two firearms. Upon 
hearing this, Officer Jones was concerned about an active shooter situation because the 
male had geared up with more than one firearm. Officer Jones then heard dispatch advise 
that the male was an off-duty sheriff’s deputy. This news increased Officer Jones’ stress 
level because it meant the male suspect was trained in firearms tactics. Dispatch advised 
the male was wearing a gray shirt and black pants. 
 
Officer Jones parked on the south side of the clubhouse. The parking lot was nearly full, 
with only a few parking spaces open on the south end. Seeing so many people at the golf 
course and knowing the suspect was a trained law enforcement officer, Officer Jones 
feared they might be facing an active shooter situation. Upon exiting his patrol unit, Officer 
Jones saw Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter armed with rifles 
 
7 Officer Jones was not using the Live 911 system, so he did not hear the 911 call.

walking across the putting green, west of the clubhouse, toward an individual on his knees 
just outside the putting green. Officer Jones heard his partners yelling commands at the 
individual (later identified through investigation as Diaz) to “Show me your hands, show 
me your hands!” Officer Jones ran to catch up to his partners. Officer Jones saw several 
civilians at the clubhouse beside the putting green. 
 
Diaz wore a gray shirt and black pants, matching the description aired by dispatch. Diaz 
faced the officers, held his left hand up, palm flat, and waved at the officers as if to wave 
them off. Officer Jones saw the handle of a black handgun in a black holster on Diaz’s 
waistband. Officer Jones drew his firearm and pointed it at Diaz. As the officers walked 
toward Diaz, Diaz kept his left hand in the air but reached with his right hand toward the 
ground beside him as if trying to find something on the ground. Officer Jones saw a black 
handgun on the ground next to Diaz, near his knee. The officers gave Diaz repeated 
commands to show his hands. Diaz ignored the commands. Diaz continued reaching with 
his right hand for the firearm on the ground but kept missing it because, instead of looking 
at the ground, Diaz looked at the officers and glanced to his left and right. Diaz was 
“mumbling,” and Officer Jones could not understand what he said. 
 
Officer Jones headed northwest. To Officer Jones’ left were Officer Sein, Officer Mutter, 
Sergeant McLane, and Corporal Campa. The officers began walking across the putting 
green toward Diaz as a team. There was no cover or concealment between the officers 
and Diaz. As they approached Diaz, the officers gave multiple orders to Diaz, telling him 
not to grab the firearm and to show his hands. Officer Jones kept his handgun pointed at 
Diaz, looking alternatively over his gun’s sights and through his gun’s sights as he 
approached Diaz. Officer Jones was scared because Diaz was not following any of their 
orders and continued reaching for the gun on the ground. Diaz kept his head up and 
looked to his left and right while reaching toward the gun on the ground with his right 
hand, repeatedly missing it. This scared Officer Jones.  As the officers got closer to Diaz, 
Officer Jones saw Diaz’s right hand touch the handgun on the ground and heard one of 
his partners yell, “Don’t do it!  Don’t do it! Don’t do it!” Diaz grabbed the handle of the 
firearm and turned onto his back. Diaz held his head up, looking straight toward Officer 
Jones with the gun “slightly behind his shoulder.” Diaz then aimed the handgun at Officer 
Jones and his partner, Officer Sein. Officer Jones was “absolutely terrified,” and knew he 
could die. Officer Jones fired four to five rounds at Diaz’s center of mass to stop the threat. 
Officer Jones stopped firing when Diaz fell onto his back, with both arms out to his side 
and dropped the firearm. Diaz’s gun landed beneath Diaz’s right armpit. 
 
The officers approached Diaz. Sergeant McLane took the firearm from beneath Diaz’s 
armpit and moved it away from Diaz. Officer Jones holstered his handgun and helped 
Sergeant McLane move Diaz onto the grass. Officer Jones used a towel to “plug up holes” 
in Diaz’s abdomen to try to stop the bleeding. Officer Jones initiated CPR while another 
officer held the towels in place to control the bleeding. Medics arrived within about two 
minutes and took over Diaz’s medical care.

On September 6, 2023, Officer Leonard Sein was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas 
Paslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Officer Sein was on duty, assigned as a field training officer to Officer 
Jones on the day shift patrol. As a field training officer, Officer Sein supervised Officer 
Jones and guided him as a trainee police officer. At about 3:45 p.m., Officers Sein and 
Jones were taking a theft report at Kohl’s on Summit Avenue when they heard the triple 
tone (emergency in progress) from dispatch. Dispatch advised that a woman had called 
to report her husband had just fired a gunshot inside their residence. Dispatch advised 
that the husband (later identified as Diaz) had walked away from the residence and was 
headed toward the Sierra Lakes Golf Course. Officer Sein told Officer Jones to start 
heading toward the golf course, less than a quarter mile from the reporting party’s home. 
As they drove to the scene code three (emergency lights and sirens), dispatch provided 
updates regarding the call. Dispatch alerted responding officers that Diaz was reportedly 
an off-duty police officer, and according to his son, Diaz had taken two firearms with him 
when he left the house. 
 
Based on his training and experience, Officer Sein knew that public places with soft 
security were common targets for active shooters. Knowing that Diaz had already fired a 
gunshot in his house and was now walking toward the golf course with two guns, Officer 
Sein believed they would be facing an active shooter. Having golfed at the Sierra Lakes 
Golf Course many times, Officer Sein was “very familiar” with the location and knew 
multiple people would be present during that time of day, both on the course and in the 
clubhouse. Officer Sein knew it was a dangerous situation with golfers likely drinking 
alcohol, which would decrease their level of awareness and affect their ability to notice 
and react to someone on the golf course armed with a gun.  
 
Officer Sein was anxious and feared for the safety of the public. Additionally, Officer Sein 
feared for his own safety and that of his partner, a new officer who had not yet 
experienced something like this in his career. Dispatch advised that Diaz had walked onto 
the golf course with the firearms and was reportedly near “the starter.” Officer Sein knew 
the starter was located southwest of the clubhouse. 
 
The golf course parking lot was full when they arrived. Officers Sein and Jones parked 
facing west in front of the front doors to the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, 
and Corporal Campa had already arrived on scene and were exiting their patrol units. 
Sergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, and Corporal Campa walked toward the starter with 
their rifles in hand. Officers Sein and Jones joined them. Officer Sein did not grab his rifle 
because Sergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, and Corporal Campa were already armed with 
their rifles. Because the officers believed they had an active shooter situation unfolding, 
it was an emergency, and as a result, they had no time to develop a tactical plan. Based 
on their training, Officer Sein knew they needed to get to Diaz quickly. The five officers 
fanned out as they walked. Officer Sein veered off to his right, passing in front of the 
clubhouse but looking to his left toward the starter. In his periphery, Officer Sein saw

people inside the clubhouse looking outside. In the distance, Officer Sein saw three 
people near the driving range who looked like they had scattered or run away. 
 
Officer Sein heard his partners begin to yell at a subject (Diaz) who was about 40 or 50 
yards away. Diaz was on his knees, leaning down in front of a golf cart stopped beside 
the curb on the “roundabout” cart path on the north side of the putting green. Diaz 
matched the description given in the call and wore a gray shirt and black shorts. Officer 
Sein “immediately started to approach [Diaz] off to the right of the other three officers,” 
who moved toward Diaz.8 Officer Sein’s goal was to take Diaz into custody and to get him 
the help he needed. The clubhouse was directly behind the officers as they made their 
approach. Officer Sein held his handgun with both hands extended out toward Diaz. Diaz 
faced south. Diaz held his left hand up in the air but concealed his right hand. It looked 
like Diaz “was trying to grab for something with his right hand” in the grass on the putting 
green on the other side of the curb. Diaz looked at the officers, then back behind himself, 
and then back at the officers, and behind himself again multiple times. The officers were 
about 20 yards from Diaz.  
 
Officer Sein could not see what Diaz was reaching for but, based on the reports detailed 
in the call for service, believed Diaz was reaching for a firearm to use against the officers. 
Officer Sein yelled at Diaz, “Don’t do it, don’t do it.” At that moment, Diaz rolled over onto 
his back and “kind of sits upright” and pointed a black handgun directly at Officer Sein. 
Officer Sein “absolutely knew that it was a firearm.” Diaz held the gun with one hand 
extended out straight from his body. There was no cover or concealment between Diaz 
and the officers. The clubhouse was directly behind Officer Sein. When Diaz pointed the 
gun at him, Officer Sein feared for his life, the lives of his partners, and the public. Officer 
Sein believed Diaz was going to use the gun to kill them. To stop the threat, Officer Sein 
fired his Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun at Diaz, aiming for his center mass/torso area. 
Officer Sein was about 15 to 20 yards from Diaz when he fired. Officer Sein fired in rapid 
succession and stopped firing when Diaz had fallen onto his back and was no longer 
pointing the gun at them. Officer Sein believed he fired seven to eight rounds but learned 
during the round count on his pistol that he had fired nine rounds. Officer Sein believed 
the other officers, including Officer Jones, who stood right next to Officer Sein, also fired 
their guns at Diaz. 
 
The officers quickly approached Diaz and began rendering medical attention. The officers 
put a tourniquet on Diaz’s right leg. Officer Sein noticed that Diaz had no pulse, so he 
started giving chest compressions until another unidentified officer took over and relieved 
him. As the other officer gave Diaz chest compressions, Officer Sein saw the gun that 
Diaz had pointed at him on the ground off to Diaz’s side. Officer Sein saw the butt of a 
second handgun sticking out of Diaz’s left pocket and directed another officer to grab the 
gun and put it off to the side. Additional officers arrived, as did medics, and the involved 
shooting officers were transported back to the police station. 
 
 
8 Officer Jones was to the right of Officer Sein.

STATEMENTS BY CIVILIAN WITNESSES9 
 
On August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:56 p.m., Witness #2 was interviewed by 
Detective Francisco Demara of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #2 was working in the clubhouse as the Food and Beverage 
Director at Sierra Lakes Golf Course. At about 3:51 p.m.,10 Witness #2 went outside to 
straighten the Sunday brunch sign and saw a man (later identified as Diaz) walking toward 
the clubhouse’s delivery gate. Diaz “looked weird, like he was on something.” It was not 
uncommon for homeless people to walk onto the golf course, and Witness #2 thought 
Diaz was a homeless person because his “movement was off.” Diaz pointed toward the 
delivery gate, and Witness #2 noticed Diaz had a black pistol in his hand. Diaz appeared 
to be talking to himself and, at times, would point the gun outward like he was going to 
shoot. As soon as Witness #2 saw Diaz had a gun, Witness #2 went back inside and 
locked the doors. Customers were inside, so Witness #2 warned them about what he had 
seen. Witness #2 ran over to the pro shop11 to tell his coworkers to lock the doors because 
there was a man outside with a gun. Witness #2 then went to the lounge/bar area of the 
clubhouse and told his coworkers to lock the doors because there was a man with a gun 
outside. A customer was trying to come inside, but the door was locked, so after making 
sure the man was not with Diaz, Witness #2 unlocked the door to let him inside. Witness 
#2 told the customer, “Hey, just get in here, there’s a guy with a gun.” 
 
Inside the clubhouse, Witness #2’s coworkers and the customers looked out the windows 
toward the putting green. Witness #2 heard someone say, “He’s by the putting green,” 
and, “The cops are already here.” Witness #2 heard about 10 to 12 gunshots but did not 
see the shooting because he was still ensuring that he had locked all the doors and was 
not focusing on what was happening outside. After the shooting, Witness #2 looked out 
the window and saw the police administering CPR to Diaz. 
 
On August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:28 p.m., Witness #3 was interviewed by 
Detectives Francisco Demara and Nicolas Craig of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s 
Department. 
 
Witness #3 arrived at Sierra Lakes Golf Course to golf during the afternoon of August 15, 
2023. Witness #3 did not recall the exact time. When Witness #3 arrived, the pro 
shop/clubhouse doors were locked. An employee let Witness #3 inside and told him there 
was a man outside with a gun. Other people were inside the pro shop, huddled by a door, 
watching out the windows. Witness #3 heard someone say, “There he is.” Witness #3 
saw a man (Diaz) outside with a gun, wearing a grey shirt. Diaz was very sweaty and 
appeared to be breathing heavily. Diaz was fidgety and seemed confused like he was 
 
9 Investigators interviewed more than 25 civilian witnesses, most of whom were present at Sierra Lakes Golf Course 
at the time of the incident under review. All interviews were reviewed, although not all are summarized here. 
10 Witness #2 knew the time because he noted it when reviewing the surveillance footage after the incident.  
11 The pro shop and clubhouse were housed in the same building.

possibly on drugs. Diaz pointed a gun at an employee who was outside wearing a hat. 
Diaz then held the gun downward and walked toward the putting green toward two parked 
golf carts. Diaz leaned against the golf cart parked closest to the clubhouse like he was 
resting. Diaz then went to the ground and put the gun down on the ground. 
 
Witness #3 saw the police arrive about 10 to 15 seconds before Diaz leaned against the 
golf cart. The police had their weapons drawn and appeared to be talking to Diaz. Diaz 
picked the gun up as the officers yelled, “Don’t do it! Don’t do it!”  Diaz “rolled on the 
ground” and then “waved” the gun at the officers like he was going to shoot, and the 
officers fired their weapons at him. Witness #3 heard at least 10 to 15 gunshots. Witness 
#3 estimated the officers were five to 10 feet away from Diaz when they fired. Witness #3 
was not sure if Diaz fired his gun, but he did not see Diaz fire. Witness #3 recorded the 
officer-involved shooting with his cell phone. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #4 was interviewed by Detective John Collopy of the 
Fontana Police Department. 
 
Witness #4 was at the first hole tee box at the beginning of the course, which was located 
down a small hill near the clubhouse by the practice putting green.12 A short distance 
from the first hole tee box was a podium where the “starter” stood. The “starter” was an 
employee of the golf course who helps keep golfers moving with their reservations. 
Witness #4 was taking practice swings when he heard the starter yell, “He has a gun! He 
has a gun!” Witness #4 saw a man walking near the podium where the starter stood. The 
man was carrying something but Witness #4 could not tell if it was a gun. Witness #4’s 
friend yelled out, “He has a gun,” so Witness #4 ran to his golf cart. Witness #4’s friend 
and his wife also ran to their golf cart. Witness #4 and his friends drove their carts down 
the course to get away from the man with the gun. As they drove away, Witness #4 looked 
back and saw the man sit down on the ground at the top of the hill near the starter podium. 
 
Once Witness #4 got to the end of the first hole, he stopped. Witness #4 saw the man 
stand up and run toward the practice putting green and out of sight. Soon after, Witness 
#4 saw police arrive. Witness #4 could no longer see the man with a gun, but he heard 
approximately six to seven rapid-fire gunshots. Witness #4 could not describe the man 
because everything happened very quickly. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #5 was interviewed by Detective Justin Moyer of the 
Fontana Police Department. 
 
Witness #5 was an employee at Sierra Lakes Golf Course and was working as a 
bartender. Witness #5’s manager came in and said, “Lock the doors,” and told him there 
was someone there with a gun. Witness #5 saw a man walking to the putting green with 
a handgun in his hand. The man was pointing the gun around and looked like he was 
trying to hide. Witness #5 saw the man at the putting green when four to five police officers 
 
12 The officer-involved shooting occurred on the practice putting green.

“came around the corner.” Initially, the man was on his knees with his hands up and 
appeared to be listening to the officers’ commands, but as the officers approached the 
man, he “hesitated” and went to pick his gun back up. According to Witness #5, it looked 
like the man picked the gun up and “kind of rolled” and then pointed the gun at the officers 
before they shot him.  
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #6 was interviewed by Detective Justin Moyer of the 
Fontana Police Department. 
 
Witness #6 was an employee of the Sierra Lakes Golf Course and was inside the main 
office when she heard someone yelling, “Fuck this.” Witness #6 heard someone banging 
on the office door and yell, “Fuck, fuck, fuck!” The person sounded like he was drunk. 
Witness #6 looked outside her window and saw the man with his back against the 
building, pointing his gun toward the parking lot. The man kept yelling, “Just fucking take 
it already, just take it already!” Witness #6’s impression was that the man was arguing 
with himself. Witness #6 hid at that point and did not see or hear anything else.   
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #7 was interviewed by Deputy Andrew Davis of the 
Fontana Police Department. 
 
Witness #7 was golfing at Sierra Lakes Golf Course when he heard someone say, “He’s 
got a gun.” Witness #7 looked around and saw a man who yelled, “Help me, someone is 
after me!” The man raised his right hand while holding a black Glock-style handgun. 
Witness #7 began running northbound through the golf course. Witness #7 then heard 
several gunshots.  
 
On August 15, 2023, Witness #8 was interviewed by Deputy Corey Garcia of the Fontana 
Police Department. 
 
Witness #8 was golfing at Sierra Lakes Golf Course and standing near the ball dispenser 
on the putting green, wearing his earbuds to focus on his golf game. Witness #8 saw ten 
people running west toward the 18th hole and heard someone yell, “He has a gun!” 
Witness #8 ran south through the putting green, past an open sidewalk area, and west 
toward the driving range. Witness #8 hid behind a large yellow “golf target” on the grass. 
Witness #8 saw five police officers walking toward the golf carts parked at the putting 
green, where a man was down on the ground. Witness #8 heard the officers say, “Drop 
the weapon,” approximately five to six times. The officers walked with guns and yelled, 
“Don’t do it!” approximately three to five times. Witness #8 heard about 10 to 15 gunshots 
and then saw the officers point their firearms down toward the ground. The officers 
immediately began to render medical aid and CPR to the man who had been shot.

911 Calls 
 
Witness #1 called 911 at about 3:48 p.m. The duration of the call was six minutes, 39 
seconds. When the 911 operator answered the call, Witness #1 asked the operator to 
“dispatch police” to her residence and provided her address. The operator asked Witness 
#1 what the emergency was. Witness #1 replied, “My husband just threw [unintelligible] 
in the house, but he left, and I don’t even know where he’s at.”  The operator asked, “He 
threw a what?” Witness #1, out of breath, apologized and explained that she “didn’t know 
how to put it.” Witness #1 repeatedly and breathlessly asked, “Where did he go?” and 
said she didn’t know where he went. The operator again asked Witness #1 what her 
husband threw, and Witness #1 did not answer. Instead, Witness #1 said, “Oh my God, 
where did he go.” The operator persisted, asking Witness #1 again, “What did he throw?” 
Witness #1 replied, “Oh, I don’t even know how to say it. He has two guns and he shoot 
the gun inside the house, and he left, but I don’t even know where he left.” Witness #1 
breathed hard and rapidly and had difficulty speaking.  
 
Eventually, the operator was able to gather more information from Witness #1. Witness 
#1 provided a description of what Diaz was wearing and advised that he left the house on 
foot, carrying his gun. Witness #1 explained that Diaz was upset and believed someone 
was going to kill him. Witness #1 told the operator that Diaz was “having an episode.” 
Witness #1 told the operator that Diaz was “off duty” and was a deputy with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and that she believed the gun he had was his duty 
weapon. During the phone call, Diaz’s son got on the phone and advised that Diaz was 
having a “manic episode,” Diaz was convinced someone was “in the walls” of the house 
and was “trying to kill him,” and that Diaz possessed two guns when he left the house. 
The 911 operator provided the information gathered during the 911 call to the officers. 
 
Additional 911 Calls 
 
At about 3:54 p.m., multiple witnesses began calling 911 to report a man with a gun at 
Sierra Lakes Golf course. One caller advised there was a man with a gun walking down 
the street waving a gun around on Medinah, off Colonial Drive, heading toward the golf 
course. Callers variously described the man with the gun as running around the golf 
course, in front of the pro shop, at the starter’s box, and near the parking lot. Callers 
provided a physical description of Diaz and advised he was wearing a grey shirt and black 
shorts and reported the man was yelling. Some callers were unable to provide a 
description, explaining that they ran away when they saw the man with a gun. 
 
As the 911 calls continued to come in, the dispatch operators began answering the calls 
and immediately asking if the caller was reporting a man with a gun at the golf course. 
 
still images displayed herein may not capture the entire image and are instead focused on the subjects. Surveillance 
videos from the golf course did not contain audio.

Sirens could be heard in the background of the phone calls and the operators assured 
the callers that officers were on scene. 
 
Surveillance Videos 
 
Surveillance cameras from the area surrounding the Diaz home recorded Diaz carrying 
two black semi-automatic handguns, one in each hand. Diaz yelled loudly and cursed. 
While at Sierra Lakes Golf Course, Diaz jogged around the golf course and the clubhouse 
patios carrying a black semi-automatic handgun in his right hand. Diaz held onto the left 
side of his waistband with his left hand. A large, heavy object appeared to be in the left 
pocket of Diaz’s black shorts. Diaz seemed to be breathing heavily and was sweating 
profusely, saturating his gray shirt.  
 
Several employees and golfers were present at the golf course; some appeared unaware 
of Diaz’s presence, while others were clearly aware of the danger, as shown by their facial 
expressions and reactions, running, and hiding, upon seeing Diaz with a gun. An 
employee driving a golf cart jumped out of the still-moving cart and ran away from Diaz. 
As Diaz scurried around the golf course property, he turned his head, looking in multiple 
directions, and appeared to take cover behind pillars and other objects. Diaz pointed the 
gun outward numerous times as if perceiving a threat but did not appear to fire it until the 
officer-involved shooting. Diaz attempted to open locked doors to the clubhouse and the 
manager’s office. Golf course surveillance videos recorded all five officers as they arrived 
on scene. The golf course surveillance cameras did not face the putting green where the 
officer-involved shooting occurred. 
 
Cell Phone Video 
 
Witness #3 recorded the officer-involved shooting with his cell phone from inside the 
clubhouse/pro shop through the west facing windows overlooking the putting green. The 
video length was one minute, seven seconds.14 
 
0:00:00 – 0:00:11 The video showed the putting green in the distance beyond the west 
clubhouse patio. Multiple people could be heard speaking inside the clubhouse, their 
voices overlapping. A golf cart was parked on the patio between the clubhouse and the 
putting green, partially obstructing the camera view of the officers as they walked on the 
putting green toward two white golf carts parked on the cart path beside the putting green. 
As the camera focus zoomed in, Diaz could be seen on his knees beside the rear driver’s 
side of the golf cart parked on the cart path nearest the clubhouse. Diaz faced in a 
southwest direction, away from the officers.

0:00:11 to 0:00:13 Diaz turned his head to the left and raised his left hand into the air as 
the officers advanced toward him with their guns drawn and aimed in his direction. Diaz’s 
right arm was not visible from the camera’s view.  
 
0:00:13 to 0:00:21 The officers walked toward the cart path, still aiming their firearms at 
Diaz. Two officers continued walking toward the cart path, out of camera view. Diaz, still 
holding his left hand in the air, twisted his torso to the right and reached toward the ground 
behind him as if trying to pick up an unseen object on the ground. Three additional officers 
came into camera view walking on the putting green toward Diaz. A person inside the 
clubhouse said, “They got him.” Diaz lowered his left hand and twisted his torso further to 
the right as he grabbed for an object on the ground with his right hand.

0:00:21 to 0:00:24 Diaz maneuvered from a kneeling position onto his right hip and side 
with his right elbow and right hand on the ground. Diaz quickly turned his torso toward the 
officers, raising his left hand. Diaz promptly sat up and pointed a black handgun at the 
officers with his right hand. 
 
 
 
0:00:24 to 0:00:25 A male voice from inside the clubhouse said, “Oh, he’s got a—” before 
being interrupted by the sound of multiple gunshots as the officers began to fire their

weapons at Diaz. The male voice then cursed loudly. Expelled gasses from the officers’ 
handguns could be seen as they fired.  
 
0:00:25 to 0:00:28 Diaz fell backward with his right hand holding the pistol in the air above 
his head. Diaz’s right hand moved as the handgun recoiled.15 Fired bullets from the 
officers’ guns struck the ground around Diaz. Gunfire ended.  
 
0:00:28 to 0:00:39 Multiple people inside the clubhouse commented on the shooting and 
said repeatedly, “Oh fuck,” and “He grabbed the gun.” The officers quickly approached 
Diaz who was on his back on the edge of the putting green and cart path. The officers 
carried Diaz onto the grass and began rendering aid. The remainder of the video showed 
the officers tending to Diaz. 
 
BODY-WORN CAMERA VIDEO16 
 
Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein activated their 
body-worn cameras prior to the officer-involved shooting. All body-worn camera footage 
recorded audio, except for Officer Jones’ footage, which did not record audio due to a 
malfunction.  
 
Officer Sein’s Body-Worn Camera Video 
 
00:00 to 00:30 Officer Sein ran in a north, northwest direction past the clubhouse toward 
the putting green. Officer Sein’s partners were captured on video as they walked across 
the putting green, guns pointed in a northwest direction and yelling commands at Diaz. 
The officers ordered Diaz not to reach for anything and repeatedly told Diaz, “Don’t do it,” 
and “Don’t do it, bud. Calm down.” The distance between Officer Sein and Diaz, combined 
with dark shadows from multiple bushes and trees, make it difficult to see Diaz until the 
00:28 second mark, when Officer Sein was positioned closer to Diaz. Diaz was on his 
knees beside a golf cart, but due to the dark shadows and video quality, it is unclear what 
Diaz was doing.  
 
00:30 to 00:33 The officers continued giving commands to Diaz as they advanced toward 
him. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter were to Officer Sein’s left. 
As Officer Sein moved closer to the cart path and Diaz, Sergeant McLane, Corporal 
Campa, and Officer Mutter were lost from camera view. Officer Jones was to the right of 
Officer Sein.   
 
 
15 During the scene investigation, two black handguns registered to Diaz (a Smith and Wesson 9mm M&P Shield and 
a Glock 45, 9mm handgun) and four “WIN 9mm Luger” fired cartridge casings were found on the ground where Diaz 
had been during the shooting. 
16 The officers were equipped with Visual Labs body-worn cameras which were mounted in the torso area. Times 
noted are from the media player bar. All body-worn camera videos were reviewed in their entirety though not at all 
summarized herein.

00:33 to 00:34 Diaz abruptly turned his torso to the right, away from Officers Sein and 
Jones. Unknown officers yelled, “Hey!” Officer Sein yelled, “Don’t do it!” as he raised his 
handgun in a two-handed grip and pointed it at Diaz. Officer Jones, to the right of Officer 
Sein, pointed his handgun at Diaz. Multiple officers yelled, “Don’t do it! Don’t do it! Don’t 
do it!”  
 
Timestamp 00:34 
 
00:34 to 00:37 As the officers yelled, “Don’t do it,” Diaz rolled onto his side, leaned 
backward and then sat up on his buttocks facing the officers. Diaz then swung his right 
hand from behind his body and pointed a handgun at the officers.  
 
00:37 to 00:40 Officer Sein fired his handgun at Diaz. Gunfire from the other officers’ 
firearms rang out. Officer Sein fired his weapon approximately nine times. At the time the 
gunshots were fired by officers, Diaz was positioned on his buttocks and began leaning 
backward. Due to the gases expelled from Officer Sein’s handgun, Diaz’s hands cannot 
be seen. All gunfire ceased at the 00:40 mark.  
 
00:40 to 01:05 Officer Sein began approaching Diaz. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, 
and Officer Mutter came into camera view from Officer Sein’s right, also approaching 
Diaz. Officer Sein announced, “I’ve got radio, I’ve got radio.” Officer Sein announced that 
shots had been fired and requested medical aid. The officers approached Diaz, who lay 
on his back partly on the cart path, partly on the green. The officers moved Diaz onto the 
green and began administering medical aid.

Corporal Campa’s and Sergeant McLane’s Body-Worn Camera Video 
 
Corporal Campa’s and Sergeant McLane’s’ body-worn cameras did not clearly capture 
the officer-involved shooting due to the camera position on the officers’ tactical vests and 
their shooting platform. However, their body-worn cameras did record the commands the 
officers gave as they moved across the putting green toward Diaz. When Corporal Campa 
reached the putting green, he pointed ahead and asked, “What’s up bro? This guy?” 
Sergeant McLane calmly commanded, “Show us your hands, bro. Show us your hands. 
Show us your hands. Put your hands up, bro. Don’t reach for nothing, bro. Don’t reach 
for nothing, man.” Corporal Campa said, “Don’t do it, dude,” followed by “Hand, hand, 
hand, hand!” Corporal Campa said, “Watch for his hand,” and “Don’t do it, dude. Keep 
your hands up, keep your hands up, keep your hands up. Don’t do it.”  Corporal Campa 
then said, “Hey, hey, don’t do it.” Additional unknown officers yelled, “Don’t do it.” As the 
officers repeatedly yelled, “Don’t do it,” Diaz briefly came into Corporal Campa’s body-
worn camera view. Diaz in a seated position, quickly turned his upper body away from 
the officers. 
 
 
 
        Timestamp 00:32 
 
Diaz was then briefly caught in the camera view as he turned his upper body back to face 
the officers at the 00:36 mark.

WEAPONS 
 
During the crime scene investigation, detectives found the following weapons registered 
to Alejandro Diaz on the putting green, along with other property belonging to Diaz:  
 
1. Black Smith & Wesson, 9mm M&P Shield. (Evidence Placard 39.)  A magazine 
loaded with seven “F.C. 9mm Luger” cartridges was inserted into the Smith & 
Wesson. A “F.C. 9mm Luger” cartridge was in the chamber.  
 
2. Black Glock 45, 9 mm handgun. (Evidence Placard 46.) A magazine loaded with 
12 “WIN 9mm Luger” cartridges was inserted into the Glock. A “WIN 9mm Luger” 
cartridge was in the chamber. Four “WIN 9mm Luger” fired cartridge casings, 
consistent with the cartridges loaded into the Glock 45, were also found on the 
putting green. (Evidence Placards 44 and 45.)

imprisonment in the state prison for five, seven, or nine years.  
 
 
APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
A peace officer may use objectively reasonable force to effect an arrest if he believes that 
the person to be arrested has committed a public offense. (Calif. Penal C. §835a(b).) 17 
Should an arresting officer encounter resistance, actual or threatened, he need not retreat 
from his effort and maintains his right to self-defense. (Penal C. §835a(d).) An officer may 
use objectively reasonable force to effect an arrest, prevent escape or overcome 
resistance. (Penal C. §835a(d).)  
 
An arrestee has a duty to refrain from using force or any weapon to resist arrest, if he 
knows or should know that he is being arrested. (Penal C. §834a.) This duty remains 
even if the arrest is determined to have been unlawful. (People v. Coffey (1967) 67 Cal.2d 
204, 221.) In the interest of orderly resolution of disputes between citizens and the 
government, a detainee also has a duty to refrain from using force to resist detention or 
search. (Evans v. City of Bakersfield (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 21, 332-333.) An arrestee or

detainee may be kept in an officer’s presence by physical restraint, threat of force, or 
assertion of the officer’s authority. (In re Gregory S. (1980) 112 Cal. App. 3d 764, 778, 
citing, In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 895.) The force used by the officer to effectuate 
the arrest or detention can be justified if it satisfies the Constitutional test in Graham v. 
Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, 395. (People v. Perry (2019) 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 469-
470.)   
 
An officer-involved shooting may be justified as a matter of self-defense, which is codified 
in Penal Code at §§196 and 197. Both code sections are pertinent to the analysis of the 
conduct involved in this review and are discussed below. 
 
PENAL CODE SECTION 196.  Police officers may use deadly force in the course of their 
duties, under circumstances not available to members of the general public. Penal Code 
§196 states that homicide by a public officer is justifiable when it results from a use of 
force that “is in compliance with Section 835a.” Section 835a specifies a police officer 
is justified in using deadly force when he reasonably believes based upon the totality 
of the circumstances, that it is necessary: 
 
(1) 
to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to 
the officer or another, or  
 
(2) 
to apprehend a fleeing felon who threatened or caused death or serious 
bodily injury, if the officer also reasonably believes that the fleeing felon 
would cause further death or serious bodily injury unless immediately 
apprehended. 
 
(Penal C. §835a(c)(1).)  
 
Discharge of a firearm is “deadly force.” (Penal C. §835a(e)(1).) The “‘[t]otality of the 
circumstances’ means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, including the 
conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.” (Penal C. 
§835a(e)(3).) A peace officer need not retreat or desist from efforts to arrest a resistant 
arrestee. (Penal C. §834a(d).) A peace officer is neither deemed the aggressor in this 
instance, nor does he lose the right of self-defense by the use of objectively reasonable 
force to effect the arrest, prevent escape or overcome resistance. (Id.) 
 
While the appearance of these principals was new to section 835a in 2020,18 the courts 
have been defining the constitutional parameters of use of deadly force for many years. 
In 1985, the United States Supreme Court held that when a police officer has probable 
cause to believe that the suspect he is attempting to apprehend “has committed a crime 
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm” to the officer or 
others, using deadly force to prevent escape is not constitutionally unreasonable.  
(Tennessee v. Garner (1985) 471 U.S. 1, 11-12.) California courts have held that when a 
 
18 Assem. Bill No. 392 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) approved by the Governor, August 19, 2019. [Hereinafter “AB-392”]

police officer’s actions are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment of our national 
Constitution, that the requirements of Penal Code § 196 are also satisfied.  (Martinez v. 
County of Los Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 334, 349; Witness #6 v. Grinder (E.D. Cal., 
Jan. 22, 2019) 2019 WL 280296, at *25.) There is also a vast body of caselaw that has 
demonstrated how to undertake the analysis of what is a reasonable use of force under 
the totality of the circumstances. (See Reasonableness discussion, infra.) As such, our 
pre-2020 state caselaw, developed upon the former iteration of section 196, is still 
instructive.  
 
There are two new factors in section 835a that did not appear in the section previously, 
nor did they develop in caselaw pertaining to use of deadly force. First, a peace officer 
must make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and warn that 
deadly force may be used, prior to using deadly force to affect arrest. (Penal C. 
§835a(c)(1).) This requirement will not apply if an officer has objectively reasonable 
grounds to believe that the person to be arrested is aware of those facts. (Penal C. 
§835a(c)(1).)  Second, deadly force cannot be used against a person who only poses a 
danger to themselves. (Penal C. §835a(c)(2).) 
 
While the codified standards for use of deadly force in the course of arrest are set forth 
at subsections (b) through (d) of Section 835a, the legislature also included findings and 
declarations at subsection (a). These findings and declarations lend guidance to our 
analysis but are distinct from the binding standards that succeed them within the section. 
In sum, the findings are as follows:  
 
(1) 
that the use of force should be exercised judiciously and with respect for 
human rights and dignity; that every person has a right to be free from 
excessive uses of force;  
 
(2) 
that use of force should be used only when necessary to defend human 
life and peace officers shall use de-escalation techniques if it is 
reasonable, safe and feasible to do so; 
 
(3) 
that use of force incidents should be evaluated thoroughly with 
consideration of gravity and consequence, lawfulness, and consistency 
with agency policies;19  
 
 
19 Penal C. §835a (a)(3) conflates a demand for thorough evaluation of a use of force incident with a dictate that it be 
done “in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency policies.” On its face, the section is 
clumsily worded. Nothing included in AB-392 plainly requires that a use of force also be in compliance with agency 
policies. A provision in the companion bill to AB-392—Senate Bill No. 230 [(2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) approved by the 
Governor, September 12, 2019] (Hereinafter “SB-230”), does explicitly state that “[a law enforcement agency’s use 
of force policies and training] may be considered as a factor in the totality of circumstances in determining whether 
the officer acted reasonably, but shall not be considered as imposing a legal duty on the officer to act in accordance 
with such policies and training.” (Sen. Bill No. 230 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) §1.) It is noteworthy, however, that this 
portion of SB-230 is uncodified, unlike the aforementioned portion of Penal C. §835a (a)(3).

(4) 
that the evaluation of use of force is based upon a totality of the 
circumstances, from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same 
situation; and  
 
(5) 
that those with disabilities may be affected in their ability to understand 
and comply with peace officer commands and suffer a greater instance of 
fatal encounters with law enforcement, therefore. 
 
(Penal C. §835a(a).)   
 
PENAL CODE SECTION 197.  California law permits all persons to use deadly force to 
protect themselves from the imminent threat of death or great bodily injury.  Penal Code 
§197 provides that the use of deadly force by any person is justifiable when used in self-
defense or in defense of others.  
 
The pertinent criminal jury instruction to this section is CALCRIM 505 (“Justifiable 
Homicide: Self-Defense or Defense of Another”).  The instruction, rooted in caselaw, 
states that a person acts in lawful self-defense or defense of another if: 
 
(1) 
He reasonably believed that he or someone else was in imminent danger 
of being killed or suffering great bodily injury; 
 
(2) 
He reasonably believed that the immediate use of deadly force was 
necessary to defend against that danger; and 
 
(3) 
He used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against 
that danger. 
 
(CALCRIM 505.)  The showing required under section 197 is principally equivalent to the 
showing required under section 835a(c)(1), as stated supra. 
 
IMMINENCE.  “Imminence is a critical component” of self-defense.  (People v. Humphrey 
(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073, 1094.) A person may resort to the use of deadly force in self-
defense, or in defense of another, where there is a reasonable need to protect oneself or 
someone else from an apparent, imminent threat of death or great bodily injury. “An 
imminent peril is one that, from appearances, must be instantly dealt with.”  (In re Christian 
S. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 783.) The primary inquiry is whether action was instantly required 
to avoid death or great bodily injury.  (Humphrey, supra, 13 Cal.4th at 1088.) What a 
person knows, and his actual awareness of the risks posed against him are relevant to 
determine if a reasonable person would believe in the need to defend. (Id. at 1083.) In 
this regard, there is no duty to wait until an injury has been inflicted to be sure that deadly 
force is indeed appropriate. (Scott v. Henrich, supra, 39 F. 3d at 915.)

Imminence more recently defined in the context of use of force to effect an arrest, is 
similar: 
 
A threat of death or serious bodily injury is “imminent” when, based on the totality 
of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe 
that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to 
immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another 
person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how 
great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, 
from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed. 
 
(Penal C. §835a(e)(2).) 
 
REASONABLENESS.  Self-defense requires both subjective honesty and objective 
reasonableness.  (People v. Aris (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1178, 1186.) The United States 
Supreme Court has held that an officer’s right to use force in the course of an arrest, stop 
or seizure, deadly or otherwise, must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s 
“reasonableness” standard. (Graham v. Connor, supra, 490 U.S. at 395.)   
The ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the 
perspective of a reasonable officer on scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of 
hindsight.... The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact 
that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in 
circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount 
of force that is necessary in a particular situation.  
 
(Id. at 396-397, citations omitted.) 
 
The “reasonableness” test requires an analysis of “whether the officers’ actions are 
‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without 
regard to their underlying intent or motivation.”  (Id. at 397, citations omitted.) What 
constitutes “reasonable” self-defense or defense of others is controlled by the 
circumstances.  A person’s right of self-defense is the same whether the danger is real 
or merely apparent.  (People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.)  If the person’s 
beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed. (CALCRIM 
505.)  Yet, a person may use no more force than is reasonably necessary to defend 
against the danger they face.  (CALCRIM 505.) 
 
When deciding whether a person’s beliefs were reasonable, a jury is instructed to 
consider the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to the person and 
considers what a reasonable person in a similar situation with similar knowledge would 
have believed.  (CALCRIM 505.) It was previously held that in the context of an officer-
involved incident, this standard does not morph into a “reasonable police officer”

standard. (People v. Mehserle (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1147.)20 To be clear, the 
officer’s conduct should be evaluated as “the conduct of a reasonable person functioning 
as a police officer in a stressful situation.” (Id.) 
 
The Graham court plainly stated that digestion of the “totality of the circumstances” is fact-
driven and considered on a case-by-case basis. (Graham v. Connor, supra, 490 U.S. at 
396.) As such, “reasonableness” cannot be precisely defined, nor can the test be 
mechanically applied. (Id.) Still, Graham does grant the following factors to be considered 
in the “reasonableness” calculus: the severity of the crime committed, whether the threat 
posed is immediate, whether the person seized is actively resisting arrest or attempting 
to flee to evade arrest. (Id.)  
 
Whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others has 
been touted as the “most important” Graham factor. (Mattos v. Agarano (9th Cir. 2011) 
661 F.3d 433, 441-442.) The threatened use of a gun or knife, for example, is the sort 
of immediate threat contemplated by the United States Supreme Court, that 
justifies an officer’s use of deadly force. (Reynolds v. County of San Diego (9th Cir. 
1994) 858 F.Supp. 1064, 1071-72 “an officer may reasonably use deadly force when he 
or she confronts an armed suspect in close proximity whose actions indicate an intent to 
attack.”) Again, the specified factors of Graham were not meant to be exclusive; other 
factors are taken into consideration when “necessary to account for the totality of the 
circumstances in a given case.” (Mattos v. Agarano, supra, 661 F.3d at 441-442.) 
 
The use of force policies and training of an involved officer’s agency may also be 
considered as a factor to determine whether the officer acted reasonably. (Sen. Bill No. 
230 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) §1. See fn. 3, infra.) 
 
When undertaking this analysis, courts do not engage in Monday Morning 
Quarterbacking, and nor shall we. Our state appellate court explains, 
 
Under Graham we must avoid substituting our personal notions of proper police 
procedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer at the scene.  We must 
never allow the theoretical, sanitized world of our imagination to replace the 
dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day.  What constitutes 
‘reasonable’ action may seem quite different to someone facing a possible 
assailant than to someone analyzing the question at leisure. 
 
(Martinez v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 47 Cal.App.4th at 343, citing Smith v. Freland 
(6th Cir. 1992) 954 F.2d 343, 347.) Specifically, when a police officer reasonably believes 
a suspect may be armed or arming himself, it does not change the analysis even if 
 
20 The legislative findings included in Penal C. section 835a(a)(4) suggest to the contrary that “the decision by a peace 
officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation”. As such, if 
the officer using force was acting in an effort to effect arrest, as is governed by section 835a, then it appears the more 
generous standard included there would apply.

subsequent investigation reveals the suspect was unarmed.  (Baldridge v. City of Santa 
Rosa (9th Cir. 1999) 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1414 *1, 27-28.) 
 
The Supreme Court’s definition of reasonableness is, therefore, “comparatively generous 
to the police in cases where potential danger, emergency conditions or other exigent 
circumstances are present.”  (Martinez v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 47 Cal.App.4th 
at 343-344, citing Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston (1st Cir. 1994) 42 F.3d 691, 695.) 
In close-cases therefore, the Supreme Court will surround the police with a fairly wide 
“zone of protection” when the aggrieved conduct pertains to on-the-spot choices made in 
dangerous situations.  (Id. at 343-344.) One court explained that the deference given to 
police officers (versus a private citizen) as follows: 
  
Unlike private citizens, police officers act under color of law to protect the public 
interest. They are charged with acting affirmatively and using force as part of their 
duties, because ‘the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily 
carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof 
to effect it.’  
 
(Munoz v. City of Union City (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1077, 1109, citing Graham v. Connor, 
[supra] 490 U.S. 386, 396.)  
 
DE-ESCALATION 
 
Diaz was on a golf course where multiple civilians were present during a busy summer 
afternoon. The presence of civilians affected the officers' decision-making process, 
forcing them to take swift action to protect the public. The officers feared that Diaz would 
become an active shooter. Because the officers recognized this danger, they had no 
choice but to locate and attempt to contain Diaz with haste.  
 
Upon seeing Diaz near the putting green, Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officers 
Mutter, Jones, and Sein approached him swiftly but with caution. Believing Diaz was 
armed with two handguns, the officers held their firearms in hand as they approached 
him. Sergeant McLane immediately began giving Diaz commands to show his hands, to 
put his hands up, and not to reach for anything. 
 
Sergeant McLane’s commands were loud, clear, and concise. The commands were 
simple and easy to follow. Sergeant McLane repeatedly told Diaz to show his hands, to 
put his hands up, and not to reach for anything. Sergeant McLane repeated the 
commands as the officers continued advancing toward Diaz. Though multiple officers 
gave commands, their commands were consistent with each other. The officers told Diaz 
precisely what he needed to do: Keep his hands in the air and not reach for anything. 
Though Diaz held his left hand in the air as if to comply with the officers, Diaz actively 
searched for his handgun with his right hand. Corporal Campa, who believed Diaz was 
reaching for a gun, warned his partners, telling them to watch Diaz's hand. Corporal

Campa then told Diaz, ""Don't do it, dude. Keep your hands up, keep your hands up!"" Diaz 
still refused to comply and continued reaching for his gun. Corporal Campa repeated the 
commands, yelling, ""Hey, hey! Don't do it!"" The other officers also yelled, ""Don't do it,"" 
multiple times. 
 
Based on the body-worn camera video footage, the officers had less than 40 seconds 
from the time they first spotted Diaz before Diaz pointed a gun at them. Though the 
officers had little time to de-escalate the situation, they gave Diaz multiple commands and 
attempted to gain his cooperation so they could safely approach him and take him into 
custody. Despite the officers' best efforts to resolve the situation peacefully, Diaz 
remained uncooperative. Instead, Diaz showed he was unwilling to comply and instead 
picked up his gun and pointed it at the officers, thwarting every attempt the officers made 
to de-escalate the situation. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
When Diaz showed up at the golf course armed with two handguns, his presence and 
behavior sparked fear in all who encountered him. Employees and golfers ran to seek 
cover and called 911 for help. Diaz was clearly in a state of mental distress and, armed 
with two loaded handguns, he posed a danger to those present at the golf course. 
Witnesses described Diaz’s behavior as abnormal and told investigators they thought 
Diaz may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Witness #1 told the 911 
operator that Diaz was “having an episode,” and had shot a gun inside the residence. 
Witness #1’s son told the operator that Diaz was “having a manic episode” and believed 
someone was “in the walls of the house” and was trying to kill him. The toxicology results 
(200 ng/mL of amphetamine and 2200 ng/mL of methamphetamine) revealed that Diaz 
was under the influence of methamphetamine. It is possible Diaz was suffering from 
methamphetamine-induced psychosis.21 Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and 
Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein knew what the witnesses had reported. While the officers 
did not know what was causing Diaz to behave this way, they correctly recognized that 
Diaz posed a danger to those around him. In the face of danger, Sergeant McLane, 
Corporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein responded to protect those 
present that day. 
 
Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter listened to Witness #1’s 911 call 
and heard first-hand her conversation with the dispatch operator. The distress in her voice 
made clear the urgency of the situation. Over the course of her six minute, 39 second 
phone call, Witness #1 advised that Diaz had fired a gun inside the house, that Diaz was 
upset, was having “an episode,” and believed someone was going to kill him. Witness #1 
told dispatch that Diaz was an off-duty sheriff’s deputy and had left on foot armed with his 
duty weapon. During the 911 call, Witness #1’s son got on the call to advise that Diaz had

left the house with two guns and explained that Diaz was having a “manic episode” and 
was convinced someone was “in the walls” of the house, trying to kill him. Officers Jones 
and Sein did not have the benefit of hearing Witness #1’s 911 call, but they knew what 
Witness #1 and her son reported because the information was provided to all responding 
officers through dispatch.  
 
The officers were aware that Diaz’s residence was located within the Sierra Lakes Golf 
Course community. Each of the officers knew that Diaz was in a state of crisis and that 
he was walking around the community armed with two handguns. Before the officers 
arrived, each of them felt a pressing concern that Diaz could become an active shooter 
at the golf course. Based on their training and experience, the officers understood that 
the golf course was a vulnerable target, where civilians, enjoying a summer afternoon of 
golf, would be unprepared and unable to effectively defend themselves. As the officers 
headed to the golf course, urgent 911 calls flooded in from witnesses reporting a man 
with a gun at the golf course, amplifying the officers’ fears and underscoring the gravity 
of the situation.  
 
Sergeant McLane called the Sheriff’s air unit to respond to the scene to assist. Fontana 
Police Department’s armored vehicle was also dispatched to the scene to assist. 
However, each officer understood the urgency of finding Diaz as quickly as possible. 
Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones and Sein were the first 
officers to arrive at the golf course. Unable to wait for assistance and determined to 
prevent any potential harm to innocent lives, the officers immediately set out on foot to 
locate Diaz. With limited opportunity to develop a tactical plan, the officers relied on their 
collective training and experience. Almost immediately, the officers spotted Diaz about 40 
yards away. Diaz was at the rear of two golf carts parked beside the putting green which 
lay in front of the clubhouse. Diaz matched the description given by multiple witnesses.  
 
When Sergeant McLane first spotted Diaz, Diaz was standing near the rear passenger 
side of the golf cart. Sergeant McLane noted a ring of sweat on Diaz’s light gray shirt, 
dark like someone’s shirt would look after an intense workout. This, combined with the 
information relayed by Witness #1 and her son during the 911 call, led Sergeant McLane 
to believe Diaz was experiencing “some type of manic physical response to reality.” Diaz 
looked in Sergeant McLane’s direction and made eye contact but quickly looked away 
and went down to his knees. 
 
Corporal Campa first saw Diaz sitting down near the two golf carts. Corporal Campa saw 
people standing at the clubhouse and asked them, “Where’s he at?” The people pointed 
at Diaz. Corporal Campa heard Diaz yell something and saw Diaz point westward, as if 
to direct the officers’ attention that direction. Corporal Campa believed Diaz was trying to 
lure the officers into an ambush to kill them because the witnesses were pointing at Diaz 
as the suspect, but Diaz was pointing the officers to the west, diverting their attention 
away from him. Before spotting Diaz, Corporal Campa had seen three to four golfers

Fatal Officer-Involved Incident 
DA STAR # 2024-20205

running north on the driving range, away from the two golf carts where Diaz sat, which 
also caused him concern.  
 
Like Corporal Campa, Officer Mutter also saw golfers running north on the driving range. 
This is what brought Officer Mutter’s attention to the two golf carts and to Diaz, who stood 
next to one of the carts. Officer Mutter saw Diaz point southward toward a thick tree line 
and heard Diaz say there was someone with a gun in the bushes. Officer Mutter shared 
Corporal Campa’s concern that Diaz was trying to get the officers closer and to divert 
their attention away from himself so “he could try to kill” one of them. Like Sergeant 
McLane, Officer Mutter also noted Diaz was drenched in sweat. Officer Mutter saw Diaz 
turn toward the officers, fall to his knees, and put his hands in the air when the officers 
began giving him commands. 
 
Because Officers Jones and Sein had to run to catch up to Sergeant McLane, Corporal 
Campa and Officer Mutter, they did not see Diaz until their partners were already walking 
across the putting green toward him. When Officers Jones and Sein first saw Diaz, Diaz 
was on his knees by the golf cart, just outside the putting green. Like Corporal Campa, 
Officers Jones and Sein saw several people at the clubhouse. Diaz faced the officers and 
held his left hand up, waving at the officers as if to wave them off. Officer Jones also saw 
the handle of a black handgun in Diaz’s waistband. Officer Sein saw three people near 
the driving range who looked like they had run away from the location. With so many 
civilians in the vicinity, the officers knew they needed to contain Diaz as quickly and safely 
as possible. 
 
Wasting no time, the officers began walking toward Diaz, and immediately began giving 
him commands. Sergeant McLane calmly told Diaz, “Show us your hands, bro. Show us 
your hands. Show us your hands,” and “Put your hands up, bro.” Diaz looked in Sergeant 
McLane’s direction and made eye contact with him. Sergeant McLane was hopeful they 
would be able to establish a positive line of communication with Diaz. Each officer had 
the same goal: to safely establish communication with Diaz so they could de-escalate the 
situation to a point where they could detain him to investigate what had occurred or 
conduct a mental health evaluation to get Diaz assistance. To that end, the officers knew 
they needed to reach Diaz and to safely disarm him. The officers did not simply charge 
forward, running straight toward Diaz, and instead made their approach tactically, walking 
toward him with great caution, all the while telling Diaz what he needed to do. 
 
As they approached Diaz, none of the officers saw a gun in Diaz’s hand. However, 
because Diaz was reportedly armed with two firearms, the officers had their guns drawn 
and held them at the low-ready. As the officers continued advancing toward Diaz, they 
repeated their commands. Diaz held his left hand in the air as if to comply but kept his 
right hand concealed from the officers’ view. Though the officers could not see Diaz’s 
right hand, based on the movement of Diaz’s right arm, it looked like Diaz was reaching 
around as if searching for something on the ground beside him. Based on the information 
and the officers’ observations of Diaz, they each reasonably believed Diaz was reaching 

PUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM 
Fatal Officer-Involved Incident 
DA STAR # 2024-20205

Page 42 
 
 
for a gun. Sergeant McLane told Diaz, “Don’t reach for nothing, bro. Don’t reach for 
nothing, man.” 
 
To reach Diaz, the officers had to traverse the putting green, which offered no cover or 
concealment between the officers and Diaz. The clubhouse was adjacent to the putting 
green. Multiple witnesses were inside the clubhouse, where they sheltered in place, 
watching Diaz and the officers through the windows. Though inside the clubhouse, these 
witnesses were in danger because of their proximity to Diaz, particularly if he began 
shooting.  
 
As the officers crossed the putting green, they fanned out to position themselves between 
the clubhouse and Diaz. Armed and in the midst of a severe mental health crisis, Diaz 
posed a danger to everyone nearby, including those inside the clubhouse and those still 
out on the golf course. While the officers did not see a gun in Diaz’s hands, they had 
every reason to believe he was armed or attempting to arm himself. To prevent Diaz from 
retrieving a weapon and potentially starting to shoot, the officers needed to contain him. 
They could not walk away from Diaz when civilians in close proximity were at risk. As law 
enforcement officers with the duty to safeguard the public, Sergeant McLane, Corporal 
Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein knew they had no alternative but to confront 
Diaz. 
 
Corporal Campa warned his partners to watch Diaz’s hands. Corporal Campa distinctly 
heard what he suspected was a gun falling to the ground and saw Diaz concealing the 
movement of his right hand from the officers. Corporal Campa told Diaz, “Don’t do it, 
dude. Keep your hands up.” Officers Mutter and Sein also noted that Diaz’s right arm was 
down, moving around behind his body as if to find something on the ground. Unable to 
see what Diaz was reaching for, the officers all feared Diaz was reaching for a gun. This 
fear was reasonable based on everything the officers had learned and observed up to 
that point. 
 
Officer Mutter yelled at Diaz, “Stop reaching, stop reaching, don’t grab it!” At the same 
time, Corporal Campa and Officer Sein repeatedly warned him, “Don’t do it!” Meanwhile, 
Officer Jones, who had moved to the right of his partners, noticed that Diaz was reaching 
for a black handgun lying on the ground beside him. Diaz continued to ignore the officers’ 
commands. Diaz went down onto his side and then onto his back, reaching behind him 
for the gun. Diaz then grabbed onto the gun, and began to sit back up, pointing it at the 
officers. When Diaz went down onto his back, Officer Jones saw Diaz grab onto the 
handle of the firearm. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officer Mutter, and Officer 
Sein all saw Diaz fall onto his side or back, but they didn’t see that Diaz had grabbed the 
firearm until he sat back up, swung his right arm toward the officers, and pointed the gun 
at them. 
 
When Diaz pointed his loaded handgun at the officers, the danger he posed escalated to 
an immediate threat. This created an urgent, life-threatening risk not only to the officers,

but to the civilians sheltering in place inside the clubhouse. When the officers saw Diaz 
point the gun at them, they each believed Diaz was going to shoot them. Sergeant 
McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein honestly and reasonably 
feared for their lives and those of the civilians in the clubhouse behind them. Confronted 
with this critical threat to their safety and the safety of the nearby civilians, the officers 
had no choice but to fire their weapons at Diaz to stop the threat.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Sergeant McLane’s 
use of deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of 
others, and therefore, his actions were legally justified. 
 
Based on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Corporal Campa’s 
use of deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of 
others, and therefore, his actions were legally justified.

of deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of others,

Officer Involved Fatality 
Date of Incident: August 8, 2023 
Location of Incident: 404 Hyland Drive, Salinas, CA  
Deceased: Anthony Tovar 
Involved Officers: MCSO Detective David Gonzalez & MCSO Deputy

Sheriff Nieto: 
 
The District Attorney’s Office has completed its investigation and review of the facts 
surrounding the officer involved shooting that occurred on August 8, 2023. The scope of 
this review is narrow. It is not to advise concerning best practices for law enforcement in 
the field, but rather to determine if any officer committed a crime beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 
Our review determined the evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt the officers 
in question committed any crime. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt the two officers who fatally shot Anthony Tovar did not have an 
actual and reasonable belief that Anthony Tovar posed a danger of great bodily injury or 
death to an officer or civilian when they fatally shot him. 
FACTS 
The investigation conducted by the District Attorney’s Office included: 
• 
District Attorney Investigator interviews of the involved officers and civilian witnesses 
• 
Review of audio and video recordings by law enforcement, including dispatch 
recordings and 911 audio recordings  
• 
Review of physical evidence 
• 
Review of all reports 
MONTEREY COUNTY 
OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
JEANNINE M. PACIONI 

On August 8, 2023, at around 8:40pm, Anthony Tovar approached a residence and repeatedly 
knocked on the door. While husband was not present, his wife and two-year old child were 
home by themselves. Wife did not open the door but became alarmed and contacted husband 
for assistance.  Tovar left before husband returned home.  Husband arrived and discussed the 
events with his wife. He observed Anthony Tovar (25) on his Ring Camera footage and 
recognized him as a neighbor from across the street.  The Ring videos show Tovar knocking 
on the door at 08:40pm, 08:41pm, and 08:49pm. Husband then went to Tovar’s address at 
407 Hyland Drive and contacted him. Tovar claimed that he had been looking for his dog.  
Husband left and returned home.  
Husband estimates that around ten minutes later, Tovar returned to husband and wife’s 
residence. Husband opened the door and stepped outside to speak with Tovar. Tovar pushed 
passed him and rushed into the house towards wife who was holding her small child. Tovar 
pulled out a knife. Tovar said that husband had the ability to release Tovar’s friends from 
incarceration. Husband begged Tovar to release his family and tried unsuccessfully to take 
the knife from Tovar. Tovar held a large knife to wife’s throat as he forced her, with her child, 
to the rear bedroom and barricaded all of them inside.  Husband frantically called 911 dispatch 
asking for a law enforcement response at around 9:30pm. 
MCSO Sergeant Gonzalez, MCSO Deputy Pantoja, MCSO Deputy Ramirez, and MCSO 
Deputy Perez responded.  At 9:33pm, dispatch advised the responding units that the male 
(Tovar) was inside the residence with a knife and had forced wife and child into the back 
bedroom at knifepoint.  At 9:34pm, Sergeant Gonzalez arrived on scene and was flagged down 
by husband who told him that a man (Tovar) was inside his residence with a knife and had his 
wife and child.  Tovar had locked the door. 
Sergeant Gonzalez, Deputy Ramirez, and Deputy Pantoja decided to immediately enter the 
residence.  After entering the residence, they rushed to the locked bedroom door and verbally 
announced “Sheriff’s Department.” Sergeant Gonzalez kicked the door multiple times and 
was able to get it open between 12 and 18 inches.  Deputy Pantoja was to his left.  Deputies 
yelled repeatedly for Tovar to “Open the door!”  Tovar had placed a dresser in front of the 
door to act as a barricade.   
Sergeant Gonzalez looked in the room and saw wife and child crying on the floor of the 
bedroom.  He also saw wife embracing her child.  He saw Tovar facing them with a large 
knife in his right hand.  The knife was over twelve inches in length.  Tovar was about five feet 
from the wife and child while Sergeant Gonzalez was five feet away from Tovar.  Sergeant 
Gonzalez pointed his handgun at Tovar and yelled several commands at Tovar to “drop the 
knife!” Tovar refused, waived his hand in a “go-away motion,” and turned his attention back 
to wife and child. Sergeant Gonzalez estimated the knife to be around 3 feet away from wife 
and child. Sergeant Gonzalez fired one shot at Tovar hitting him in the torso. Deputy Pantoja 
fired one shot and Sergeant Gonzalez fired two more shots. Tovar fell to the ground.  The 
knife was removed from his hand, he was handcuffed, first aid was administered, and medical 
personnel were dispatched. Tovar was pronounced dead on scene. 
  
 

LEGAL STANDARDS 
The California District Attorneys Association charge filing standard directs prosecutors to 
assess whether the evidence would warrant conviction by a jury, which requires proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt. The sole purpose of this review is to determine whether any 
officer was criminally responsible for the death of Anthony Tovar. 
On August 19, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 392 into law, which 
changed the law governing the use of deadly force by police officers and went into effect 
on January 1, 2020. 
Under PC 835a(c)(1), “a peace officer is justified in using deadly force upon another person 
only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such 
force is necessary . . . to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury 
to the officer or to another person.” It also allows for the use of deadly force, “[t[o 
apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious 
bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious 
bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where feasible, a peace officer 
shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace 
officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has objectively 
reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts.” 
“A threat of death or serious bodily injury is ‘imminent’ when, based on the totality of the 
circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the 
present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious 
bodily injury to the peace officer or another person.” (Id. at subsection (e)(2).) 
The statute states that totality of the circumstances “means all facts known to the peace 
officer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use 
of deadly force.” (Id. at subsection (e)(3).) 
Under the law, any person—including a police officer—can use deadly force in self-defense 
or in defense of others if the person reasonably believes the immediate use of deadly force is 
necessary to defend against an imminent danger of great bodily injury or death. The danger 
does not need to exist as long as the person reasonably believes the danger exists. Further, a 
person acting in self-defense or defense of others is not required to retreat. The person is 
entitled to stand his or her ground or even, if reasonable, to pursue an assailant until the 
danger of death or bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been 
achieved by retreating. 
Police officers can lawfully use deadly force even if from 20/20 hindsight other feasible 
options may have existed. The situation must be viewed from the perspective of a reasonable 
officer at the scene. Officers are forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances 
that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in 
a particular situation. 
When a person has a genuine belief using force in self-defense, or defense of others, is 
immediately necessary, a person is not guilty of a homicide unless the belief in self-defense, 
or defense of others, was unreasonable at the time.  
   

CONCLUSION 
There is no basis to conclude that Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja had anything but a 
genuine belief that deadly force was immediately necessary. Because Tovar kidnapped the 
mother and her two-year-old child at knifepoint, imprisoned them in their rear bedroom 
behind a barricaded closed door, displayed a deadly weapon, failed to follow the lawful 
commands of deputies, and given the totality of these unpredictable and extremely dangerous 
circumstances, the deputies could reasonably believe Tovar was an imminent threat to the 
lives of his captors.  Therefore, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that Sergeant Gonzalez or Deputy Pantoja committed any crime.  
The role of the District Attorney is not to evaluate the efficacy of departmental tactics or 
training, nor of course to consider issues of civil liability. Those processes may have the 
goal of identifying areas for improvement in future similar encounters; they may take 
advantage of the benefit of hindsight and information not known to the involved peace 
officers. The role of the District Attorney in deciding whether to charge officers with a crime 
requires judging their conduct and actions from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the 
scene at the time of the incident with the information available in a rapidly evolving high-
stress encounter. Consequently, having found there is insufficient evidence to prove any 
crime beyond a reasonable doubt, no further action by this office is contemplated or 
warranted.

barricaded himself and the two victims inside a bedroom, Monterey County Sheriff’s Office 
personnel breached the door and discharged their firearms fatally striking Tovar.  
 
NARRATIVE: 
On 08/08/2023 at approximately 2220 hours, I was alerted that an OIS had occurred at 404 Hyland 
Dr. in Salinas and I was requested to respond to the scene by District Attorney Investigative 
Captain (DAIC) J. Ferreria. I arrived on scene at approximately 2310 hours. I was designated the 
Lead Investigator by DAIC Ferreria. I was assisted by District Attorney Investigators (DAI) Smith, 
Gomez, and Williams. It should be noted that DAIC Ferreria and DAI Williams left the scene to 
photograph Monterey County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) personnel involved in the shooting and 
they conducted a round count of the associated OIS weapons. DAI Smith and I were then directed 
to obtain a statement from the reporting party, Victim 1. It should be noted that Victim 1 was 
seated in an MCSO patrol vehicle prior to the interview. It should also be noted that I audio-
recorded the interview with Victim 1 with my department-issued digital recorder (Item KH 1). The 
following is a summary of the interview with Victim 1.  
 
SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTIM 1:  
After exiting the patrol vehicle, DAI Smith and I identified ourselves to Victim 1 and he agreed to 
speak with us. Victim 1 confirmed he lived at 404 Hyland Dr. with his wife, Victim 2, and their 
two-year-old daughter, Victim 3. Victim 1 provided verbal consent to search the home regarding 
our investigation. Victim 1 stated a male adult, later identified as Decedent Tovar, entered his 
home, proceeded into the kitchen area of the home where he grabbed Victim 2 and Victim 3 and 
took them into a rear bedroom of the residence utilized by Victim 3.  
 
Victim 1 stated Tovar first approached the residence at approximately 2030 hours on 08/08/2023. 
Victim 1 was not present at the residence but was informed that Tovar was knocking 
“aggressively” on the front door and side door of the residence while Victim 2 was inside the 
residence with Victim 3. Victim 2 did not open the doors. After arriving at the home, Victim 1 did

not see Tovar. However, Victim 1 accessed his Ring camera which was mounted next to the 
residence’s front door. After he reviewed the Ring camera’s video to see who had been knocking 
the residence’s front door earlier on 08/08/2023, Victim 1 said, “It seemed like the neighbor.” 
Victim 1 stated he went across the street to attempt to discover why Tovar had been knocking on 
the door. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar come around the side of a pink residence (407 #A 
Hyland Dr.) behind 407 Hyland Dr. According to Victim 1, Tovar stated he had been looking for 
his dog at Victim 1’s residence earlier in the evening. Victim 1 and Tovar then parted ways.  
 
Victim 1 stated Tovar returned to 404 Hyland Dr. and knocked on the front door about 10 minutes 
after his first encounter with Tovar. Victim 1 opened the door and noted Tovar was “acting kind 
of weird because he wanted to step inside the house.” Victim 1 stated he told Tovar they could 
speak outside the residence. However, Tovar went around Victim 1, entered the residence through 
the open front door, and approached Victim 2 in the kitchen area of the residence. Victim 2 was 
holding Victim 3. After grabbing Victim 2 and Victim 3, Tovar brandished a knife. Victim 1 stated 
that Tovar made several comments including, “you have to help me, because I have some friends 
in prison, and you have power to get them out.” Victim 1 stated he pleaded with Tovar to release 
Victim 2 and Victim 3 and to leave the residence. Victim 1 stated he began struggling with Tovar 
and unsuccessfully attempted to grab of the knife. Tovar then forced Victim 2 and Victim 3 into 
the residence’s rear bedroom and locked the door leaving Victim 1 outside the bedroom. Victim 1 
then called law enforcement.  
 
Victim 1 confirmed Tovar had the knife prior to entering the residence. Victim 1 stated Tovar 
made additional comments about friends in prison and that Victim 1 had the power to release these 
individuals from incarceration. Victim 1 stated he didn’t know Tovar but believed Tovar was 
associated with the pink residence behind 407 Hyland Dr.  
 
Victim 1 stated after he called law enforcement, he continued to plead with Tovar to release his 
family and to not hurt them. Victim 1 exited the residence and spoke with law enforcement when

they arrived. When law enforcement entered his residence, Victim 1 followed but was ordered to 
leave the residence. Victim 1 confirmed he was inside the home when he heard gunshots. Victim 
1 stated he did not hear anything prior to the gunshots. Victim 1 stated Tovar spoke mostly to 
Victim 1 after entering the home in the kitchen area, mainly concerning the release of Tovar’s 
incarcerated friends. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar grab Victim 2 around her shoulders and 
Tovar had the knife behind Victim 2.  
 
Victim 1 stated when Tovar first knocked on the residence’s front door, Victim 2 contacted Victim 
1 to inform him of the situation. Victim 1 arrived at the residence approximately 10 minutes later 
and accessed his Ring camera system. Victim 1 stated he attempted to speak with Tovar through 
his Ring camera system but the battery was low and he was unable to communicate with Tovar.  
 
DAI Smith and I had no additional questions for Victim 1 and ended the interview at approximately 
2335 hours.  
 
NARRATIVE: 
After the interview with Victim 1 was concluded, DAI Smith and I remained at the scene of the 
OIS. MCSO Forensic Evidence Technician (FET) R. Okaneku arrived and began processing the 
crime scene. DAI Smith accompanied FET Okaneku while FET Okaneku processed the crime 
scene. DAI Smith also took digital photographs of the scene. I remained on scene with DAI Smith 
and FET Okaneku (See reports from FET Okaneku and DAI Smith). I left the scene of the OIS at 
approximately 0430 hours on 08/09/2023.  
 
On 08/09/2023, I assisted DAI Smith with processing several evidence items recovered from the 
OIS scene (See DAI Smith’s report). Later on 08/09/2023, DAI Gomez and I contacted Victim 2 
at 17105 El Rancho Way in Salinas. It should be noted that Victim 2 spoke Spanish only. DAI 
Gomez, who is a certified Spanish speaker with Monterey County, conducted the interview (See 
DAI Gomez’s report). During the course of the interview with Victim 2, DAI Gomez and I were

informed Tovar grabbed Victim 2’s pants and attempted to pull them down while Tovar held her 
inside the bedroom at 404 Hyland Dr. causing her underwear to rip. Victim 2 provided the grey 
underwear to DAI Gomez. I took two digital photographs (Item KH 3) of the grey underwear 
before DAI Gomez collected them as evidence (Item LG 01). Item LG 01 was later booked into 
evidence at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office.  
 
DAI Gomez and I were also informed Tovar’s grey sweatshirt/jacket had not been removed from 
404 Hyland Dr. DAI Gomez and I accompanied Victim 1 to 404 Hyland Dr. and I recovered the 
grey sweatshirt/jacket (Item KH 2) which was located on top of the bed in the rear bedroom where 
the OIS occurred. I also took three digital photographs of the grey sweatshirt/jacket before I 
collected the item (Item KH  4). Item KH 2 was later booked into evidence at the Monterey County 
District Attorney’s Office. Items KH 1 and KH 3 – KH 4 were booked into digital evidence at the 
Monterey County District Attorney’s Office.

SYNOPSIS: 
On 08/08/2023, an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS) occurred at 404 Hyland Drive in Salinas.  
Monterey County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) Deputies responded to a call of a man with a knife. 
Anthony Tovar had forcibly taken a mother and her two-year-old child at knife point into a 
bedroom and barricaded the door. MCSO Deputies breached the bedroom and observed Tovar 
with a knife.  The deputies discharged their firearms striking Tovar.  Tovar did not survive.   
 
NARRATIVE: 
On 08/08/2023 at 2219 hours, I received a request to respond to an OIS that had occurred on the 
400 block of Hyland Drive in Salinas, CA.  I arrived at the scene at approximately 2236 hours.  I 
contacted Chief District Attorney Investigator, Ryan McGuirk, and District Attorney Investigative 
Captain, John Ferreria, who directed District Attorney Investigator (DAI), Hunsaker, and I to 
interview the Reporting Party (RP), Jose De Jesus Valdivia.  During the interview, Valdivia gave 
us verbal consent to enter and search his residence located at 404 Hyland Drive. Please refer to 
DAI Hunsaker’s report for a summary of Valdivia’s interview.   
 
Once we obtained consent to enter Valdivia’s home, DAI Hunsaker and I were tasked with locating 
and documenting evidence within the residence.  We were notified that MCSO’s Forensic 
Evidence Technician (FET), Rebeka Okaneku, was enroute and we would be assisting in 
processing the scene.   
 
Once FET Okaneku arrived, I was tasked with taking digital photographs of the scene which 
included the residence at 404 Hyland Drive, the evidence located within the residence, and photos 
of the decedent. After the photographs were taken, we marked each evidence item with yellow 
numbered placards.  I took additional photographs of the evidence items with the placards.   
 
I stood by as FET Okaneku took multiple scans of the residence at 404 Hyland Drive.  Once the

scans were completed, I collected the following evidence from the residence: 
 
• Item RS-001, 9mm shell casing WMA +P+ (Placard 3) 
• Item RS-002, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 4) 
• Item RS-003, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 5) 
• Item RS-004, Knife w/ black handle, approximately 300 mm in length (Placard 6) 
• Item RS-005, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 7) 
 
It should be noted that placards 1 and 2 were placed next to black latex gloves that were found at 
the scene.  The items were photographed, but the gloves were not taken as evidence.  The coroner 
deputy arrived on scene to examine and prepare the decedent’s body for transport.  When the 
coroner deputy moved the decedent’s body and searched his pants pockets, an iPhone, a Mercedes 
car key, and a DeWalt box cutter were found in the pockets.  When the coroner deputy moved the 
decedent’s legs a spent projectile (bullet) was found that had been under the decedent’s boots.  I 
took photographs and collected the items that were found in the decedent’s pockets as well as the 
mushroomed projectile (bullet).  They were labeled as the following evidence items: 
 
• Item RS-006, Black iPhone w/ gray case 
• Item RS-007, Mercedes car key w/ gray fob attached. 
• Item RS-008, DeWalt box cutter (yellow/black) 
• Item RS-009, Spent Projectile (mushroomed) 
 
The evidence items were labeled, packaged, and placed in an evidence locker at the Monterey 
County District Attorney’s Office for storage.  Two hundred and eleven photographs were taken 
of the scene.  I uploaded the photographs into Evidence.com and labeled the folder as evidence 
item RS-010.  Three additional photographs were taken of evidence item RS-004 (Knife) once I 
was at the office.  I photographed the knife alongside a scale to show the length of the knife and 
the blade.  I uploaded those photographs to Evidence.com as item RS-011.

The below photo shows Dep. Pantoja’s spare magazines, flashlight and Taser: 
 
 
Dep. Pantoja’s firearm was a department issued Glock 17, 9mm, semi-automatic handgun, serial 
number MCSO676 with three 17 round capacity magazines. There was one round in the chamber 
of Dep. Pantoja’s handgun and 16 rounds in the magazine inserted into his handgun. Dep. Pantoja’s 
other two magazines were loaded with 17 rounds each. At the time of the OIS, assuming Dep. 
Pantoja had one extra round kept in the chamber of his handgun, and all of his magazines were 
fully loaded, I determined Deputy Pantoja fired one round during the OIS.

Gonzalez’s other two magazines were loaded with 17 rounds each. At the time of the OIS, 
assuming Sgt. Gonzalez had one extra round kept in the chamber of his handgun, and all of his 
magazines were fully loaded, I determined Sgt. Gonzalez’s fired three rounds during the OIS. 
 
I collected both Dep. Pantoja’s and Sgt. Gonzalez’s department issued Glock 17s along with a 
single magazine each as evidence. 
 
On 08/09/2023 at approximately 0030 hours Captain Ferreria and I left MCSO and returned to the 
scene. I remained at the scene until approximately 0300. 
 
I copied all of the photos I took from the round count into Karpel as evidence. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Forward to DAI Kris Hunsaker for review.

NARRATIVE:  
On August 8, 2023, at approximately 2300 hours, I, Monterey County District Attorney 
Investigator (DAI)  Leo Gómez , arrived at the crime scene at Captain John Ferreria’s request. I 
contacted Victim 1 at his parent’s home, which was located at 17105 El Rancho Way, Salinas CA 
93907. Victim 1 signed a consent form (Item LG05) to search his residence. I signed this document 
as a Witness, and I forwarded it to DAI Kris Hunsaker. Victim 1 also delivered to me four digital 
videos (Item LG02) from his Ring camera that was installed at the front door of his residence.

These videos showed Decedent Tovar and his dog outside the victim’s front door. I also delivered 
this evidence to DAI Hunsaker. 
 
Conversations with Tovar’s relatives: 
On August 9, 2023, at approximately 1104 hours, DAI Rachel Maldonado and I visited Tovar’s 
home and we spoke to a number of Tovar’s family members who were gathered there praying. 
Among the large group were Tovar’s parents, his sister and her husband. I spoke to these persons 
in Spanish and I gathered additional information about Tovar’s mental history and whereabouts 
the day before. One of the Tovar’s sisters (Noemí) spoke both English and Spanish. I recorded our 
conversation using a digital device and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com (Item LG03). 
I also photographed the Tovar’s medication and a knife we found at the home, which resembled 
the knife Tovar used to kidnap the victims. The following is a synopsis of my conversation with 
Tovar’s relatives. For complete details, please refer to the audio file. The names of the family 
members I spoke to were Berta Murillo and Ernesto Tovar (Tovar’s parents), Noemí Tovar 
(Tovar’s sister) and Jorge (Noemí Tovar’s husband.)  
 
Mental Illness: 
Tovar’s parents stated that Tovar had lived with them through his whole life and was unemployed 
at the time of the officer-involved shooting (OIS). Tovar attended North Monterey County High 
School for approximately two years but did not graduate. There was consensus among the relatives 
that Tovar suffered from mental illness and was taking some medications but the length of his 
illness,  depending on who spoke, was either three, four or ten years. Tovar’s parents did not 
exactly know what Tovar’s diagnosis was, but Noemí indicated that he suffered from 
schizophrenia. Ernesto and Berta stated that Tovar was being treated at Natividad Hospital for 
mental illness and, sometime in the past, he had been housed at psychiatric facilities in Monterey 
and Santa Cruz counties.  The Santa Cruz County stay lasted approximately one week and occurred 
sometime in 2021.

Bertha stated that Tovar’s illness began in adulthood and manifested with hallucinations. Bertha 
described Tovar talking to invisible persons. Bertha also stated that Tovar “didn’t sleep” and spent 
all night walking around their home. The relatives stated that Tovar was often profane and verbally 
abusive towards his parents but he was never violent at home. The relatives also stated that Tovar 
had been arrested multiple times for various reasons, including mental illness, bad temper, and for 
entering a neighbor’s home without permission. Tovar’s relatives did not know that neighbor’s 
name, but they indicated that the neighbor came to Tovar’s home and told his parents that he would 
shoot Tovar with a gun if he ever entered his home again. Bertha stated that on one occasion, Tovar 
called her from the Monterey County Jail and stated that he could see her and Ernesto inside the 
jail with him. 
 
Noemí and Jorge stated that they knew Tovar better than anyone else because Tovar often visited 
them at their home (1157 Ranchero Drive, Salinas CA  93905) and he spent a lot of time with 
them. They also stated that Tovar ‘s ex-girlfriend, whose first name was Destiny, was one of their 
neighbors on Ranchero Drive. 
 
Illicit drugs use: 
Noemí, Bertha, Ernesto and Jorge stated that Tovar used illicit drugs, including cannabis and 
methamphetamine, which he obtained from friends. They also stated that Tovar’s mental illness 
intensified with drug use. Noemí stated that Tovar began using drugs after he completed probation. 
Noemí also stated that Tovar told her that he was anxious about finishing probation, so he could 
start using cannabis. 
 
Tovar’s whereabouts preceding the OIS: 
Jorge stated that one or two days before the OIS, around 0400 hours, Tovar went to Destiny’s 
home and climbed on the roof without permission. Jorge learned about this incident from Noemí, 
who was informed by Destiny’s father, who saw him on the roof but did not call law enforcement. 
Destiny’s father spoke to Jorge about that incident and he was upset.

On the date of the OIS, Tovar visited Noemí at her home and she became afraid of him because 
he was “acting up.” Noemí was unable to explain what she meant by “acting up,” but she 
mentioned that Tovar was moving and touching his face. Her description seemed to describe the 
behavior of someone under the influence of a stimulant. Noemí also stated that Tovar was “out of 
control” because he had broken up with Destiny. Tovar was still with Noemí when Jorge got home 
from work at approximately 1900 hours, although he was outside the home in his car, which he 
had driven to Noemí’s home. 
 
Jorge described that when he arrived home, Tovar was “OK” but lacked concentration, which he 
attributed to the roof climbing incident at Destiny’s home. Jorge told Tovar that he did not want 
him at his home anymore because of the trespassing incident at Destiny’s home.  
 
Noemí cried (presumably at the prospect of not having Tovar visit her home again) and Tovar 
apologized for his behavior and stated that he would not bother Destiny anymore. Tovar left Noemí 
and Jorge’s home crying, in his vehicle, after Noemí also told him that she didn’t want him at her 
home due to the ongoing drama with Destiny. She also told him that she feared he would do 
something to her or her children when Jorge wasn’t home. Noemí explained that she feared Tovar 
because he did not take his medication and he was abusive to her parents. 
 
Tovar’s relatives did not know when Tovar had last slept or for how long before the OIS, but they 
believed that he had been awake for 24 or 48 hours since the roof climbing incident at Destiny’s 
home.  
 
Berta stated that sometime during the evening, prior to the OIS, she saw Tovar standing outside 
her home, talking to a man. The man told Tovar in Spanish, “I saw you in the cameras” and “what 
were you doing there?” Tovar told the man, “I went to get the dog. The dog went over there and I 
went to get him.” Tovar’s relatives described Tovar’s dog as a white Chihuahua. Ernesto also heard 
the conversation between Tovar and the man, and he provided a statement that substantiated

Bertha’s narrative. Sometime thereafter, Bertha noticed police vehicles near her home and she 
went outside and called Tovar but he was nowhere to be seen. Ernesto stated that after speaking to 
the man, Tovar entered his home through a rear door and went to the kitchen. Berta and Ernesto 
didn’t know where Tovar went thereafter he was in the kitchen. 
 
Tovar’s medications:  
Inside Tovar’s home, on a kitchen shelf, I observed multiple medication containers, three of which 
had labels from the CVS pharmacy located at 110 Laurel Drive, Salinas, CA 93906. The labels 
indicated that the medications were prescribed to Tovar by doctors K. Routiher or M. Garuba.  
 
The label on the first container was dated June 10, 2023, and read “15 mg Mirtazapine  tablet” and  
“Take 1 tablet by mouth every day at bedtime.” The prescription was for 30 tablets and the 
container held 29 tables labeled  “0 8 A”  which I verified on the drugs.com website as the imprint 
for Mirtazapine, an antidepressant. The following two images are photographs of this medication: 
 
The label on the second container, dated October 21, 2021, indicated a prescription for 60 
Buspirone Hydrochloride 15 mg pills. The label read, “1 tab by mouth twice daily.” The container 
held 57 intact tables labeled  “5 5 5 TV 1003”  and four half- tablets of the same medicine. The 
drugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the container label. The image 
below is a photograph of this medication: 
 
The label on the third container, dated July 20, 2022,  indicated a prescription for 30 Olanzapine  
5 mg tablets. The label read, “take 1 tablet every day at bedtime.” The container held 26 intact 
tables labeled  “CL 40.” The drugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the 
container label. The following image is a photograph of this medication:

The large number of tablets found in each container, coupled with the date of the prescriptions and 
instructions, seemed to corroborate Noemí’s statement about Tovar not taking his medications. 
Knife found in Tovar’s kitchen: 
On a counter, in Tovar’s kitchen, we found a knife similar to the one Tovar used during the 
burglary and kidnapping. We did not find a knife set or any other knives. The image below is a 
photograph of this knife:

Conversation with Victim 2: 
On August 9, 2023, at approximately 1423 hours, DAI Hunsaker and I spoke with Victim 2 at her 
father-in-law’s home. Present during our conversation was her husband, Victim 1. I recorded our 
conversation using a digital device (Item LG04) and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com. 
 
Victim 2 stated that she resided at her home with her daughter (Victim 3) and her husband. On the 
date of the OIS she was at home with her daughter. Victim 1 arrived home from work  at 
approximately 1500 hours to eat, and he returned to work at approximately 1600 hours. 
 
At approximately 2030 hours, someone knocked on her front door, which was closed but unlocked. 
Victim 2 believed that the person at the door was her husband, so she approached the door, looked 
through the door glass, and noticed that the person outside was not her husband, but a young man 
(Tovar) with a small dog. Tovar was wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and a gray or black item over 
his face. Tovar made eye contact with Victim 2, hand signaled for her to open the door and 
remained there for five or ten minutes. Victim 2 panicked and did not open the door. 
 
Victim 2 took her daughter to her master bedroom, stayed there some time, called Victim 1 and 
told him that a stranger was knocking at the front door. Victim 1 told Victim 2 that he was coming 
home and would arrive in ten minutes. Tovar stopped knocking on the front door for approximately 
three minutes and began knocking on the side door that was located on the home’s north side, 
between the kitchen and Victim 3’s room. This door led from the kitchen to the driveway. 
 
Victim 2 called Victim 1 a second time and he tried to talk to Tovar via their front door camera, 
but the device was not working. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that he was driving home and would 
be there soon. When he arrived, Victim 1 told Victim 2 that, based on what he saw through the

front door camera, he believed Tovar was one of their neighbors. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that 
he was going to go talk to that neighbor (Tovar) to see what he needed or wanted. 
Victim 1 walked to Tovar’s home, which was located in an alley perpendicular to the victim’s  
street.  After speaking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned home and told Victim 2 that Tovar had gone to 
their home looking for a dog. After talking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned to his residence, and 
approximately ten minutes later, Tovar returned to the porch of the victim’s residence, while 
Victim 1 was taking his work clothes off to get in the shower. 
 
Victim 1 went outside and talked to Tovar, leaving his front door ajar. Tovar ran inside the victims’ 
residence, stood approximately 10 feet away from the front door and produced a knife, while 
Victim 1 stood at the door. When Tovar entered the home, Victim 2 was in the kitchen and her 
daughter was sitting at the kitchen counter, close to the dining room. 
 
Tovar told Victim 1 to close the front door and made incoherent statements, demanding that Victim 
1 help him get his family members and his daughter out of prison. Victim 1 told Tovar to go outside 
with him and let his wife and daughter go. 
 
At some point, Tovar moved closer to Victim 1  (farther away from the child), so Victim 2 took 
advantage of this opportunity to run and pick up Victim 3 from the counter area. She held the child 
in her arms and brought her to the kitchen, behind the counter, near the stove, and away from 
Tovar. Victim 2 grabbed her cellular telephone to call 911 but Tovar told her not to call the police. 
 
While Tovar was making his incoherent demands, Victim 2 attempted to escape with her daughter 
through the aforementioned kitchen side door. Victim 2 held the child with her left arm against her 
chest and handled the door knob with her right hand, but she was unable to open it. 
 
When Victim 2 was facing the side door and struggling to open it, Tovar approached her, stood 
behind her, and prevented her escape by wrapping his left arm across her chest and putting his

knife, with his right hand, against the right side of her neck. Victim 2 felt the blade against her 
skin.  
I asked Victim 2 if she could re-enact this frightening event and she demonstrated Tovar’s actions  
by standing behind Victim 1, wrapping her left arm across his chest and placing her right hand 
against the right side of his neck. 
 
When Tovar held Victim 2 and her daughter hostage in the kitchen, Victim 1 had his cellphone in 
his hands, and Tovar told him not to call the police. Tovar then turned Victim 2 and her daughter 
around 180 degrees, away from the side door and made them face the kitchen refrigerator. Tovar 
then turned Victim 2 and her daughter ninety degrees to the left of the refrigerator and pushed 
them with force, against their will away from the kitchen, towards the child’s bedroom, which was 
located to the east of the kitchen, down a short and narrow hallway.  
 
Tovar kidnapped the Victim2 and Victim 3, closed the child’s bedroom door behind him and also 
closed the bedroom’s window curtain. Tovar ordered Victim 2 to sit at the foot of the bed, which 
she did, as she held her daughter close to her chest with both arms. Tovar began pacing along a 
dresser that was located to the right of the bedroom door, along the bedroom’s west wall. 
 
Tovar then handed Victim 2 his cellular telephone and told her to dial Victim 1’s number. Victim 
2 complied and handed the phone back to Tovar, who continued walking around the room. Victim 
2 did not know if Tovar was able to talk to Victim 1, but eventually Tovar placed his phone on a 
dresser and told Victim 2 that nothing was going to happen to her or her daughter. 
 
Tovar pulled all the dresser drawers out, looking for a gun and he asked Victim 2 if there was a 
gun in her house. Victim 2 told him that there were no guns at her home. Sometime thereafter, 
Victim 2 and Tovar heard sirens, and Tovar told her in Spanish, “I told your husband not to call 
the police, now all of us are going to get fucked.”

Tovar then told Victim Guzmán to put down and let go of her daughter but she refused and  
continued holding the child with both arms against her chest, while sitting at the foot of the child’s 
bed. Tovar removed his belt from his pants, threw it somewhere and unbuttoned his pants.  
 
Tovar, holding his knife in one of his hands, used his other hand to pull down Victim 2’s leggings. 
Tovar grabbed the leggings and pulled them down with force from the waist area two or three 
times. While describing this horrible ordeal, Victim 2 used her hands to re-enact her and Tovar’s 
actions. Victim 2 moved her left arm away from her daughter, continued holding her against her 
chest with her right arm, and swiftly grabbed the top of her leggings near the area where Tovar 
was trying to pull them down and she prevented him from taking her clothes off. Victim 2 told 
Tovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police inside the room and she asked him to not 
do anything to her. 
 
Tovar continued pulling Victim 2’s clothing with such force that he ripped her underwear and 
pulled Victim 2 and her daughter off the bed. Victim 2 remained on the bedroom floor, holding 
her daughter. 
 
While describing the frightening assault, Victim 2 instinctively pulled her leggings down and 
showed DAI Hunsaker and I the hole in her underwear, which she was still wearing. At the 
conclusion of the interview, Victim 2 handed me her ripped underwear, which I delivered to DAI 
Hunsaker for booking at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office (Item LG01). 
 
Victim 2 believed that Tovar was going to sexually assault her. She feared for her life and 
expected Tovar to stab her with the knife at any time because she had already felt the blade against 
her neck. Victim 2 told Tovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police come inside the 
room and she asked  him to not do anything to her. She also repeatedly yelled at Victim 1 not to 
let the police enter the room, as Tovar had told her that he did not want law enforcement

involvement. Victim 2 specifically told Tovar, “I am telling him (Victim 1) not to let them in, so 
don’t do anything to me, I’m pregnant.” 
The deputies who rescued Victim 2 arrived at the barricaded bedroom door when Victim 2 was on 
the floor, holding her daughter, with Tovar standing above them with his knife. Victim 2 heard the 
rescuing deputies give commands to Tovar before they entered the bedroom but she did not 
understand what they said because she did not speak English. 
  
 
When the rescuing deputies forced the bedroom door open, Victim 2 was still on the floor holding 
her daughter. Tovar stood up between Victim 2 and the deputies and they continued giving 
commands to Tovar. Victim 2 did not understand the commands, but she believed the deputies 
ordered Tovar to drop his knife. Sometime thereafter, Victim 2 heard a gun shot and she observed 
blood and flesh coming out of one of Tovar’s forearms. Victim 2closed her eyes when she saw 
Tovar’s blood hit one of the bedroom walls, and she covered her daughter’s eyes with her left 
hand, as she heard two additional shots.

barricaded himself and the two victims inside a bedroom, Monterey County Sheriff’s Office

NARRATIVE: 
On 08/11/2023 at approximately 0940 hours, DAI Torres and I conducted an interview with MCSO 
Acting Sergeant/Detective David Gonzalez who was involved in the OIS. The interview was 
conducted at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office in Salinas. Also in attendance was 
Sgt. Gonzalez’s legal counsel, Terry Leoni. It should be noted that I audio-recorded the interview

After obtaining the information as noted above, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez to describe in detail the 
incident that occurred on 08/08/2023 at 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was near the west 
end of Boronda Rd. near Hwy. 183 prior to the OIS. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was informed by 
dispatch that a male subject had entered a residence with a knife. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he made 
sure the responding deputies were using their emergency lights and sirens enroute to Hyland Dr. 
Sgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch he was near Hyland Dr. and stated he had not activated his 
emergency lights and sirens to respond. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was going to stage in the area 
when he was advised the male subject had a knife and was with the reporting party’s (RP) wife 
and child. Sgt. Gonzales stated he thought this situation was “a hostage/rescue kind of ordeal.”  
 
Sgt. Gonzalez arrived at El Rancho Way and Hyland Dr. and was approached by the RP (Victim 
1). Sgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch of his contact with the RP and that the RP had informed Sgt. 
Gonzalez the suspect was in a rear bedroom with a knife along with the RP’s wife and child. Sgt. 
Gonzalez observed another deputy behind him and told the deputy, “Let’s go. We’re going to make 
entry into the house.” Sgt. Gonzalez entered the residence at 404 Hyland Dr. and was told by the 
RP the suspect was in the back room and gave permission for Sgt. Gonzalez to kick down the 
interior bedroom door. Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door once and observed the door had 
been barricaded by a “heavy object.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated when he noticed the barricade, “That 
kind of like triggered in me like a different feeling. Like, this is serious and there is a lot of truth 
to what this guy’s saying that there’s going to be, we’re going to open the door and we’re going to 
be faced with some kind of scenario.”  
 
Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door harder a second time near the door handle breaking the 
door panel. Sgt. Gonzalez was able to open the bedroom door approximately 1 – 1 ½ feet to look 
inside the bedroom. When Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door, Deputy Cristian Pantoja was

on Sgt. Gonzalez’s left side while Deputy Josue Ramirez was behind Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy 
Pantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez looked into the bedroom and saw a lady and child, later identified as Victim 
2 and Victim 3 respectively, sitting on the floor of the bedroom in “the northeast corner.” Victim 
2 was crying and holding Victim 3. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he observed the suspect, later identified 
as Decedent Tovar, standing approximately five feet away from the female and child. Tovar was 
facing toward Sgt. Gonzalez but was holding and pointing a knife at the female and child. It was 
then requested to take a break in the interview. 
 
After the break, Sgt. Gonzalez continued with his statement. Sgt. Gonzalez described the bedroom 
as a small room. After kicking the bedroom door, Tovar was looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy 
Pantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez saw the knife in Tovar’s hand which Sgt. Gonzalez described as a “kitchen 
knife, 9 inches, he was holding it by the handle, pointing it at the lady and the child.” Sgt. Gonzalez 
gave verbal commands to Tovar to drop the knife. Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning 
his gaze towards the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez then fired one round at Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez 
said he had previously drawn his pistol upon entering the home and his pistol was kept at “low 
ready” until he encountered Tovar.   
 
Sgt. Gonzalez recognized the object blocking the bedroom door as a clothes dresser approximately 
3 – 4 feet tall and the dresser did not allow the door to be fully opened. Sgt. Gonzalez also observed 
a closet behind Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “What was going through my head at that point was 
if he gets an opportunity, and he lunges at them with the knife, was that he was going to harm the 
child or the lady, and if he came at us, I would get stabbed or my partner would get stabbed. And 
so as soon as he turned to look at the lady, that’s when I fired my first shot.” Sgt. Gonzalez said 
the shot struck Tovar in the front torso. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar returned to “an aggressive 
stance” and Tovar continued to hold the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez ordered Tovar to 
drop the knife and heard Deputy Pantoja also order Tovar to drop the knife.

Sgt. Gonzalez described Tovar as 5’ 6” to 5’ 8” with short hair and thin build. After the first shot,  
Sgt. Gonzalez said Tovar again looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning his gaze toward the 
female in the room. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he then fired three additional rounds striking Tovar at 
least twice. Sgt. Gonzalez noticed a spent shell casing in the air and deduced Deputy Pantoja fired 
his pistol as well. After being struck, Tovar fell to the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez heard someone state 
that Tovar still had the knife. Another deputy removed the knife from Tovar and Sgt. Gonzalez 
removed the female and child from the room. Sgt. Gonzalez turned over the female and child to 
Deputy Perez and Sgt. Gonzalez returned to the bedroom where he observed the knife was on the 
floor between Tovar and the female’s location prior to her removal from the room.  
 
Sgt. Gonzalez provided his handcuffs to Deputy Ramirez who handcuffed Tovar. First aid was 
then administered to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez cleared the remainder of the home and cleared medical 
personnel to enter the residence to continue to administer first aid to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez directed 
Deputy Perez to separate the female and the RP into separate vehicles. Sgt. Gonzalez assisted in 
directing the set up of the crime scene and making the appropriate notifications of the OIS to 
dispatch. Sgt. Gonzalez directed photographs be taken of the crime scene and the victims. Sgt. 
Gonzalez then returned to MCSO. Sgt. Gonzalez said the RP indicated Tovar was a neighbor and 
Sgt. Gonzalez could not state if he knew the suspect by sight from any previous encounters.  
 
When I asked, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did announce “Sheriff’s Office” after entering the residence. 
Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did not attempt to force the door open further after kicking the door the 
second time as he and Deputy Pantoja were able to see Tovar through the established opening. Sgt. 
Gonzalez confirmed Tovar held the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez was not given a 
description of Tovar prior to encountering Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he ordered Tovar to drop 
the knife 3 – 4 times.

Sgt. Gonzalez did not believe he had any additional options available regarding his use of force 
given the circumstances of the call. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “At that point with what we were 
addressing, we were presented with a deadly force situation where there was no time to react for a 
Taser because a Taser could be ineffective.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar appeared to be unaffected 
by the first gunshot. Sgt. Gonzalez said, “In my mind, there was no other option.” Sgt. Gonzalez 
explained the use of a Taser had several drawbacks including agitating Tovar causing Tovar to 
lunge at Sgt. Gonzalez or the female or child.  
 
DAI Torres asked Sgt. Gonzales what was going through his mind when he fired the second volley. 
Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar was still “looking for a target because the knife was, like he’s ready to 
go, he’s looking to see, he looked at me and then he looked at the lady and that’s kind of where, 
and the knife was so close to them where it would take one step, one half second, and he could 
have injured like whether it’s fatally or not fatally, and that’s kind of where I thought that he was 
going to take action with the knife.” Sgt. Gonzalez clarified “take action” to mean stabbing the 
victims. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he constantly addressed Tovar and did not give commands to the 
other deputies inside the residence.  
 
Sgt. Gonzalez also clarified that when Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez, Tovar was “scanning for an 
option to attack” and that was the basis for Sgt. Gonzalez’s first shot. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the 
distance between himself and Tovar to be approximately five feet and Tovar was also 
approximately five feet away from the female and child who were on the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez 
stated Tovar was standing, holding the knife while “scanning and looked like he was thinking 
about what he was going to do. So if he had lunged at the lady, in my head, I thought we would 
not be able to shoot because she would be part of the backdrop. I didn’t want to give him that 
opportunity. Whereas if he had lunged at us, we would still have a clear shot.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated 
other than his commands to Tovar to drop the knife, he did not have time to attempt any other 
forms of de-escalation. Additionally, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did not have time to discuss the use 
of less than lethal options prior to entering the residence.

Sgt. Gonzalez estimated 1 – 2 minutes elapsed from the time he entered the residence until the 
shots were fired. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar did not say anything during the encounter. Sgt. 
Gonzalez stated had there been ample time to retrieve the less than lethal shotgun, it could have 
been feasible to use. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the call from dispatch, the information he obtained from 
the RP, and the fact the bedroom door was barricaded, confirmed his belief Tovar was the intruder. 
Sgt. Gonzalez said the female was seated on the floor and was “sheltering” the child by holding 
the child with both arms.  While both were crying, neither victim made any comments during the 
incident.  
 
I asked Sgt. Gonzalez what he believed Tovar’s intent was when he first observed Tovar standing 
in the room with the knife. Sgt. Gonzalez said, “To inflict like serious bodily harm on someone.” 
Sgt. Gonzalez believed Tovar was intent on injuring somebody. Another break in the interview 
was taken at this time.  
 
After this break, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez several follow-up questions. I asked Sgt. Gonzalez to 
describe the female’s position on the floor while holding the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female 
was sitting on the floor with her feet near her buttocks providing shelter for the child. Sgt. Gonzalez 
estimated the child to be approximately 2 – 3 years old. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the female to be 
in her mid-20s. The female had her arms wrapped around the child. Sgt. Gonzalez said the female 
and child were chest-to-chest facing each other. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female appeared to be “in 
fear for her life” as she was crying. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he believed the female was in fear of her 
life because she was crying and she was sheltering the child from Tovar by wrapping her arms 
around the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he thought Tovar was going to stab either the female or the 
child with the knife because of the way Tovar was holding the knife and the way Tovar “target 
scanned” by looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and then returning his gaze toward the victims attempting 
to ascertain which target would be the easiest to stab. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the knife was 
approximately three feet away from the female and her child.

Based on his training and experience, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez what possibilities existed with a 
suspect holding a knife three feet away from a potential victim. Sgt. Gonzalez responded, “A 
person could get stabbed. It takes less than a second.” Sgt. Gonzalez did not recall Tovar moving 
during the encounter. DAI Torres asked if the distance between Tovar and the female and child 
changed during the encounter and Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “No.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated after the first 
shot was fired, Tovar maintained the same position and the knife remained approximately three 
feet away from the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez could not remember if Tovar moved toward 
the female and child after the first shot was fired.  
 
Sgt. Gonzalez had no additional information to provide but said, “It was just a very dramatic 
situation at the time.” When I asked Sgt. Gonzalez if he had previously encountered Tovar, he said 
he recognized Tovar’s name after reviewing the CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) and he knew 
Tovar lived in the area. Sgt. Gonzalez said he knew Tovar, but he did not recognize Tovar during 
the encounter inside 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez said Tovar had previously registered with him 
as part of Tovar’s 290 PC status.  
 
I had no additional questions for Sgt. Gonzalez and ended the interview at approximately 1045 
hours.

NARRATIVE: 
On 8/11/23 at approximately 1059 hours, Monterey County Sheriff Office (MCSO) Deputy 
Cristian Pantoja was interviewed regarding his involvement in the Officer Involved Shooting 
(OIS) that occurred on 08/08/23.  Also present during the interview was attorney Terry Leoni 
(Leoni Law Firm) representing Deputy Pantoja, and District Attorney Investigator (DAI) Kris 
Hunsaker.  The interview was audio recorded (Items TT 1 and TT 2) using my department issued 
cellular phone. Items TT 1 and TT 2 were later uploaded into digital evidence at the Monterey 
County District Attorney’s Office. 
 
Deputy Pantoja confirmed this interview was voluntary, and he was not ordered, coerced, or

compelled to provide a statement. Deputy Pantoja also had the opportunity to consult with his 
attorney prior to this interview.   
 
Deputy Pantoja was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, and 
experience.  The following is a summary of his responses:   
 
Deputy Pantoja said he is employed with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and is a Deputy in 
training.  Deputy Pantoja has been in the field training program for approximately 2 ½ months.  
He has been employed with the Sheriff’s Office for 4 years and was a jail deputy prior to his 
current assignment.  Deputy Pantoja has attended the basic police academy and does not hold any 
auxiliary assignments.  Deputy Pantoja has not attended any specialized training other than the 
police academy.   
 
On the day of this interview, Deputy Pantoja was 29 years of age, and his current title is Deputy 
in training.  Deputy Pantoja is issued a Glock 17 Pistol that utilizes a 9 mm round.  Deputy Pantoja 
is also assigned a patrol rifle.  The rifle is a Colt rifle that fires a .223 round.  The pistol and rifle 
have an added department-issued flashlight attached to them.  The pistol has been issued to Deputy 
Pantoja for approximately 4 years.  The rifle has been issued to him for approximately 1 year.   
 
Deputy Pantoja does not carry a backup weapon.  Deputy Pantoja performs functions checks before 
every shift on both of his issued firearms.  Deputy Pantoja qualified with both firearms the week 
he started the field training program.   
 
On the day of the incident, Deputy Pantoja was wearing a class A uniform which consists of a shirt 
with Sheriff’s Office patches on both sleeves.  He was wearing green class A pants and a duty belt.  
Deputy Pantoja also had a badge on his left chest and a name plate on the right chest.  Deputy 
Pantoja carries two (2) pairs of handcuffs, radio, flashlight, collapsible baton, Glock 17 pistol, 
taser, OC spray and two (2) pistol magazines on his duty belt.   
 
On the day of the incident Deputy Pantoja was in a marked Sheriff’s Office patrol car.  The vehicle 
is equipped with emergency lights and siren.  The vehicle is not equipped with a camera.  Deputy 
Pantoja said the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office does not issue body worn cameras to deputies.     
 
Deputy Pantoja went on to recall the events of the day of the incident.  Deputy Pantoja said he was 
dispatched to a call that was a 911 hang up.  He was told by dispatch that a caller had said there 
was someone with a knife and then the call was disconnected.  Deputy Pantoja was finishing a 
traffic stop at the time he was contacted by dispatch.  After getting in his vehicle, a location was 
given on Hyland Drive.  Deputy Pantoja activated his emergency lights and siren and responded 
to the area.   
 
While driving to the location, additional information was being provided to Deputy Pantoja.  
Deputy Pantoja said he was told that a suspect was locked in a room armed with a knife, with a

female adult and a child.  Upon arriving, Deputy Pantoja said he saw Sgt. Gonzalez running 
towards the residence where the suspect was located.  Deputy Pantoja followed Sgt. Gonzalez into 
the residence.   
 
Deputy Pantoja said due to the severity of the information he was provided, he unholstered his 
firearm.  When he entered the residence, Deputy Pantoja saw a male adult in the living room of 
the house.  He ordered the adult to exit which he did.  Sgt. Gonzalez went down a hallway inside 
of the residence to a closed door.  Sgt. Gonzalez attempted to open the door, but it was locked.   
 
Sgt. Gonzalez told Deputy Pantoja to take a “breach position.”  Deputy Pantoja believed this meant 
they would kick the door open.  Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the door approximately two (2) times.  
Deputy Pantoja said he began to feel fear because it was unknown what was inside of the room.  
Deputy Pantoja said he knew someone had a knife and possible hostages inside of the room.  
Deputy Pantoja said the door appeared to be barricaded and it opened only slightly after being 
kicked.   
 
Deputy Pantoja said he looked inside of the room, and he could see a female adult who appeared 
to be holding a small child and was in distress.  The female was crying as was the child and they 
were on the bedroom floor.  Deputy Pantoja said the female adult appeared to be in fear for her 
life.  Deputy Pantoja said he was holding his firearm in a low ready position and was scanning the 
room.  Deputy Pantoja said he saw a Hispanic male adult holding what appeared to be a kitchen 
knife in his hand.  Deputy Pantoja said he was afraid because he did not know the suspect’s abilities 
with the knife.  Deputy Pantoja said he began to give the suspect commands such as “drop the 
knife.”   
 
Deputy Pantoja said he felt afraid for his life as well as the life of the female and child.  The suspect 
was in close proximity to the victims as well as the deputies.  Deputy Pantoja said that the suspect, 
later identified as Anthony Tovar, was not listening to any of the commands the deputies were 
giving him.  Deputy Pantoja yelled at Tovar and said, “look at me.”  Tovar looked at Deputy 
Pantoja and waived his hand in a motion that Deputy Pantoja took as “go away.”  Tovar was in a 
bladed stance and holding the knife out in front of himself.  Tovar then began to turn away from 
Deputy Pantoja and Sgt. Gonzalez towards both victims.  Deputy Pantoja said he heard 
approximately three (3) rounds go off from Sgt. Gonzalez’s pistol.  Tovar flinched and had a 
physical reaction to the shots.  Deputy Pantoja said he believed the shots had struck Tovar.   
 
Tovar then turned completely around with his back to the deputies.  He faced both the female and 
the child with the knife still in his hand.  The blade of the knife was pointed at both victims.  Deputy 
Pantoja said it was at this time he believed it was Tovar’s intention to kill both the woman and 
child.  Tovar took a step in the victims’ direction with the blade of the knife pointed directly at 
them.  Deputy Pantoja estimated Tovar was only a few feet away from the victims at this time.  
Deputy Pantoja fired a single shot at Tovar.  Tovar stopped and showed a flinch or physical

reaction to the single shot.  Tovar then collapsed with the knife still in his hand.  Tovar was on the 
floor motionless.  Deputies forced their way in the room and removed the knife from his hand.   
 
Deputies rendered basic first aid to Tovar.  Fire and AMR were also requested over the radio.  
Tovar was still breathing and had a pulse during this time.  Fire and AMR arrived and took over 
first aid efforts.  At this time Deputy Pantoja was relived from the scene.  The interview ended 
around this time.

NARRATIVE: 
At approximately 1130 hours, I met with Monterey County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) Deputy Josue 
Ramirez, Attorney Terry Leoni, and Monterey County District Attorney Investigator Justin Bell at 
the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office for an interview. The interview was audio 
recorded using my department issued digital recorder, and officially began at 1158 hours.  
 
It should be noted that due to a break during the interview, there are a total of two audio recordings 
for this interview.  The first interview will be labeled Interview Part 1, and the second, Interview 
Part 2.  
 
Deputy Ramirez stated that this interview was voluntary, and he was not ordered, coerced, or 
compelled to provide a statement.  He also had the opportunity to consult with his attorney prior 
to this interview.   
 
Deputy Ramirez was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, 
and experience.  The following is a summary of his responses: 
 
Deputy Ramirez is currently assigned to the patrol division of the Monterey County Sheriff’s 
Office (MCSO), which was the capacity he was working at the time of the Officer Involved 
Shooting (OIS). Deputy Ramirez was also a breacher on the MCSO SWAT team, a drone operator, 
and a Field Training Officer (FTO). Deputy Ramirez has been a sworn deputy with MCSO since 
2015 (approximately 8 years).  He did not work for any other departments prior to MCSO. Deputy 
Ramirez’s badge/CAD number is R8475, and on the day of the OIS his call sign was 1Z3.  Deputy 
Ramirez is 31 years old.   
 
Deputy Ramirez has training in the police academy, CPR training, less lethal force options training 
and arrest and control techniques training. He has not yet attended CIT training for Crisis 
Intervention or Critical Incidents.

On the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirez was carrying the following firearm: 
• Glock 17, 9mm – Primary Duty Weapon 
This firearm is department-issued.  Deputy Ramirez has had this firearm for over 5 years.  
The only modifications were a mounted flashlight and grip additions.  He last qualified 
with this weapon in March of 2023, which was also the last time he did a function check. 
The magazine was loaded to capacity (17 rounds) plus one in the chamber.   
 
Deputy Ramirez did not fire his weapon during this incident.   
 
At the time of his response to the scene, Deputy Ramirez was dressed in his patrol uniform which 
consisted of a tan shirt, green BDU uniform pants, a tan outer carrier bearing a badge, name plate, 
MCSO patches on both sleeves and a patch on the back of the carrier which read “Sheriff.” Also 
on the carrier were a flashlight, pepper spray, taser, baton, handcuffs, magazines, and an admin 
pocket with pens and a notepad. Deputy Ramirez wore a duty belt with only his firearm which was 
in a drop-down holster attached to his leg.  He also wore tactical boots.   
 
On the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirez’s assigned vehicle was patrol unit 3089.  Deputy Ramirez 
was working in an FTO capacity the evening of the shooting, and he shared this vehicle with his 
trainee, Deputy Pantoja, who conducted an inspection on the vehicle prior to the start of the shift.  
Deputy Ramirez believed all the equipment in the vehicle was functioning. The vehicle was 
equipped with a less lethal shotgun.  Deputy Ramirez said the vehicle usually has a WRAP, which 
is a device used to restrain combative individuals. He did not know if the WRAP was in the trunk 
that evening since he did not inspect the vehicle. The vehicle was not equipped with any cameras.   
 
Deputy Ramirez was then asked to explain in his own words the circumstances surrounding this 
OIS.  The following is a summary of his statement:

Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja were on patrol and had just cleared a traffic stop in the city 
of Salinas at Boronda Road and North Main St.  Dispatch advised of a 911 hangup call where a 
reporting party (RP) reported a man was inside of his residence with a knife.  While enroute to the 
scene, dispatch updated something regarding a mother and a child; however, due to the chaos he, 
could not recall any more details.   
 
Deputy Pantoja was driving, and they headed towards the residence with lights and sirens 
activated.  Deputy Ramirez was the passenger and was talking to Deputy Pantoja making sure they 
knew where they were going and the fastest route to take.   
 
Deputy Ramirez heard Sergeant David Gonzalez advise he had arrived on scene just a few seconds 
before he and Deputy Pantoja arrived.  Deputy Ramirez saw Sergeant Gonzalez speaking with a 
male outside in front of the house.  As they were exiting the vehicle, they saw Sergeant Gonzalez 
run into the home.  Deputy Pantoja immediately ran after Sergeant Gonzalez.  Deputy Ramirez 
immediately followed Deputy Pantoja.  As he entered the home, Deputy Ramirez could see 
Sergeant Gonzalez at the right side of a door in a hallway just past the kitchen.  Deputy Pantoja 
met and stood to the left of that same door.  Sergeant Gonzalez began to kick in the door as Deputy 
Ramirez arrived and stood directly behind Deputy Pantoja.  He said the room was at the northeast 
corner of the home.   
 
As the door was kicked open, they noticed it was obstructed by an object, and they could not enter.  
Deputy Ramirez could not see inside, but he knew Deputy Pantoja and Sergeant Gonzalez were 
challenging someone as they shouted, “Drop the knife.”  As this was going on, Deputy Ramirez 
was able to see into the opposite side of the room where a mother and a child were on the floor. 
He described them as being terrified, trembling, and hugging each other.   
 
Deputy Ramirez said commands continued towards the suspect to drop the knife.  Deputy Ramirez 
said he also made commands to drop the knife even though he could not see the suspect.  Deputy

Ramirez then heard a firearm discharge followed by more commands to drop the knife.  Deputy 
Ramirez heard a firearm discharge again, and then they entered the room.  As they entered, Deputy 
Ramirez could see the suspect on the floor.  He also saw the knife. 
 
Deputy Ramirez went directly to the mother and child, got them up and escorted them out of the 
room.  Deputy Ramirez returned to the room, handcuffed the suspect, turned him over and began 
to render medical aid (refer to the audio recording for details on Deputy Ramirez’s efforts to treat 
the suspect).  AMR and fire personnel arrived a short time later and took over medical treatment 
of the suspect.   
 
Deputy Ramirez recalled that the officers present during the shooting were Sergeant Gonzalez, 
Deputy Pantoja, Deputy Perez and himself.  
 
I followed up with questions for Deputy Ramirez regarding his mindset during this incident. After 
hearing initial radio traffic, Deputy Ramirez was in fear for the mother and child.  He said he has 
two daughters himself, so this was terrifying.   
 
Deputy Ramirez said he had no prior knowledge of the suspect, and he did not know who the 
suspect was.  Deputy Ramirez said he had no interactions with the suspect prior to the shooting, 
and the only time he saw him was after deputies entered the room.  Prior to the shooting, Deputy 
Ramirez did not hear or see the suspect.  
 
Deputy Ramirez did not recall if any description of the suspect was broadcasted prior to his arrival.  
Deputy Ramirez’s mindset upon arrival was that he needed to be with his sergeant and Deputy 
Pantoja.  He said he did not know if Sergeant Gonzalez heard or saw something, but since he ran 
into the house by himself, Deputy Pantoja and Deputy Ramirez immediately followed him so they 
could go in together.

Deputy Ramirez said there was no plan formulated during this incident, and everything happened 
so quickly that he could only react to the other officers’ actions. Deputy Ramirez did not hear 
communication during the call amongst officers, but he was the last to walk up.  As he walked up, 
he put his hand on the shoulder of Deputy Pantoja in preparation for room entry and to alert Deputy 
Pantoja that Deputy Ramirez was behind him.  This was for tactical purposes as he was trained 
during SWAT.  Deputy Ramirez said that had they been able to enter the room at that point, he 
would have remained with Deputy Pantoja and provided him direction while dealing with the 
situation.  Due to the circumstances, Deputy Ramirez was not able to do this.  
 
Upon arrival at the scene, Deputy Ramirez recalled Sergeant Gonzalez talking to a male he 
believed to be the reporting party.  The male appeared to be in a state of panic. Deputy Ramirez 
did not hear their exchange.   
 
Deputy Ramirez did not recall anyone on scene verbally identify themselves as law enforcement.  
He said the command of “drop the knife” was given several times.  He said it was more than two. 
He could not recall any background noise that would obstruct the suspect’s ability to hear 
commands.   
 
Deputy Ramirez described the layout of the residence as a living room that feeds into the kitchen.  
The kitchen leads to a hallway where the door to the room is located.  This was where the four 
officers were positioned as they challenged the suspect.  From where he was standing in the 
hallway, Deputy Ramirez estimated he was 10 feet from the mother and child in the room.  
 
Deputy Ramirez said he did not discharge his weapon.  Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja 
discharged their weapons.  
 
I asked Deputy Ramirez what he thought the suspect was trying to do.  He mentioned there were 
many unknowns regarding the suspect and he was worried he would violently hurt the mother and

the little girl. He was thinking the worst based on the fact he believed the suspect was a random 
person in the home, and he was worried of a violent sexual assault.  
 
DAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez if any information he received gave him the sense of the type of 
call this was, specifically to know whether this was a stranger or a domestic violence situation.  
Deputy Ramirez responded that he could not discern what type of call it was, nor could he know 
if there were issues with the RP. In his mind, Deputy Ramirez understood this to be a hostage 
situation based on the information he was given.  
 
Deputy Ramirez said that there were no other force options available to deal with the situation.  He 
said that everything happened very quickly and the deputies that shot had to instantly react to what 
was in front of them.  From the time they entered the home until the time of the shots, Deputy 
Ramirez estimated it was less than a minute. In his mind, when he saw the door was intentionally 
blocked by the suspect, he believed the suspect was trying to prevent anyone from entering the 
room.    
 
DAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez about the potential danger of a person with a knife, based on his 
training and experience.  He said a knife can cause severe damage or life-threatening injuries.  It 
could take seconds for a person with a knife to severely injure someone.  In this situation, there 
was not enough time to run to a vehicle to get a less lethal option.  When they arrived, the 
immediate instinct was to be with Sergeant Gonzalez, so he was not by himself, and Deputy 
Ramirez needed to remain with Deputy Pantoja.  
 
Deputy Ramirez said that upon opening the door, it opened about a foot.  With the layout of the 
hallway and the amount of space available, they would not have been able to deploy a taser or 
other less lethal options.  Deputy Ramirez did not have a good angle or view to deploy one of these 
options.

Deputy Perez told me the following in summary: 
 
Deputy Perez is normally assigned to coastal patrol, but they were short staffed in Salinas 
and he volunteered to be reassigned. Deputy Perez was with Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja 
at a traffic stop at Boronda Rd. and North Main Street. At approximately 2132, hours he received 
a dispatch call from Monterey County Communications that a male was reporting that a subject 
was in his house with a knife locked in a room. He said the details were vague at that time. 
 
Deputy Perez responded to 404 Hyland Drive with lights and sirens (code 3) behind Deputy 
Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja. He received updates that the reporting party (RP) was asking them 
to hurry, and said that the subject was in the house with his wife with a knife.  
 
Deputy Perez heard Sgt. Gonzales attach himself to the call. They received an update that 
there was a man with a knife locked in a room with the caller’s wife and child. Sgt. Gonzales 
arrived and updated over the radio that he was being flagged down by a male.  
 
Deputy Perez arrived on scene shortly after. Deputy Perez saw Deputy Pantoja and Deputy 
Ramirez running towards the front of the house. Deputy Perez started running after them then 
paused for a second and thought that he should get the less lethal shotgun out of his trunk. Deputy 
Perez saw Sgt. Gonzales “basically leap into the house” and he felt that Sgt. Gonzales had more 
information because he had arrived first and had spoken to the RP already. Based on Sgt. Gonzales’ 
actions and the information he had already received, Deputy Perez felt that the circumstances were 
so exigent that there was not time to go back and get the less lethal shotgun. Deputy Perez ran 
towards the house.  
 
Deputy Perez said based on the information he had received from dispatch told him that 
they needed to get into the house quickly. He felt that the subjects were in danger, and he felt that 
there was just no time. Based on the information he had, he felt that the suspect’s intention was to 
harm the woman and child or the responding deputies.  
 
When Deputy Perez got to the front door of the residence, he, the RP, and another male 
were standing just outside the house and he told them to get farther away. When he was inside, he 
could hear kicking “bang bang” and the voice of Sgt. Gonzales yelling “open the door, open the 
door” When Deputy Perez got to the hallway, he could see Sgt. Gonzales to the right and Deputy

Pantoja a little bit to the left. Deputy Perez was right behind Deputy Ramirez. He could see that 
the door was open 1.5 to 2 feet and appeared to be barricaded by a dresser with a mirror attached 
to it. He could see the deputies trying to push it but it would not move. At that time all he could 
see through the opening in the door was the dresser blocking the doorway and the back wall of the 
room. Deputy Perez could not see the mother and child or the suspect in the room. He then heard 
“drop the knife, drop the knife” before hearing a bang, and then another bang. He said there was 
about 5 seconds between the first bang and the second bang. 
 
I asked if there was anything going on at the time of the commands to drop the knife that 
would have prevented someone from hearing the deputies. He said there was not. I asked if he 
heard any announcements that it was the police or sheriff’s department, and he said, “no.”  
 
When Deputy Perez saw that the door was barricaded, Deputy Perez thought that meant 
that the victims were in danger. That meant that the suspect was not going to come out, and was 
going to harm the child or the mother, because he had barricaded himself in with them.  
 
Deputy Perez turned around and saw the RP behind him and had to tell him to get back 
outside. 
 
Deputy Perez had to help get the door open because it was still barricaded. He saw the 
suspect on the ground wounded and the mother and child huddled over in a fetal position crying 
with the mother bear hugging the child. They ended up breaking the door basically in half and 
climbed over the dresser to get inside the bedroom. Deputy Perez pulled the mother and child out 
of the room and checked them to make sure they were okay. A little later AMR Ambulance arrived. 
Deputy Perez put the mother and child into his patrol car, and put the husband into another patrol 
car.  
 
Deputy Perez was told to remain with Deputy Pantoja and they did not discuss anything 
about the incident.  
 
I asked, based on his training and experience, what threat someone with a knife posed. He 
said a knife could easily kill or seriously injure the victims. 
 
I asked if Deputy Perez had the less lethal shotgun upon his arrival into the house, if it 
could have changed the way the situation was handled. Deputy Perez said he did not think so.

Firstly, the less lethal shotgun has a standoff distance. Based on the fact that it was such a small 
room he would not have been able to deploy it safely. Additionally, if the less lethal shotgun was 
not effective, the suspect could have been angered and then taken out his aggression on the victims 
while they were barricaded in the room. He said that door was so effectively barricaded that it took 
the deputies substantial time and effort to get the door open even after the suspect was down. 
 
Deputy Perez also described that he could not see the suspect from his position in the 
hallway, and that he would have needed to get around and in front of the other deputies before he 
would have an opportunity to use it, and in doing so he would have removed their ability to deploy 
lethal force and have lethal cover.  
 
Deputy Perez said he did not hear any sound from inside the room prior to the shooting, 
and could not see the suspect. He did not hear any words from the suspect. He did not have any 
prior knowledge of the suspect or the residence they had entered.  
 
Deputy Perez thought that maybe 1 or 2 minutes passed between his arrival on scene and 
the shooting. He said the whole scene was so dynamic and fast, everything happened in a split-
second decision.  
 
Deputy Perez never fired his weapon. Deputy Perez said he did not render medical aid to 
the suspect because he was responsible for the victim and her child. 
 
Deputy Perez said he did not think they had any other force options based on how quickly 
the events transpired. They did not even get a chance to think about using OC or other options. He 
said OC also would not have been a good option because everyone would have been effected by 
it in such a confined space, and they would have lost control over the whole situation. 
 
He felt that if they had tried a taser, people are aware of how to defeat the taser. He felt if 
they had tried to tase the suspect and it failed, he would have been angered into action to harm the 
victim and her child. Deputy Perez said the suspect had the advantage over them the entire time. 
Based on what Deputy Perez saw once in the room, he understood the suspect was a lunge away 
from the victims and it would have taken less than a second for him to harm them.

SUMMARY:  
At the time of this investigation, I was employed as a Monterey County District Attorney’s Office 
(MCDA) Investigator (DAI). On Friday, August 11th, 2023, I was assigned to attend the autopsy 
of decedent Anthony Tovar at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) Coroner Autopsy 
Suite. The autopsy was conducted by Chief Forensic Pathologist Dr. Stephany Fiore, it began 
around 0900 hours and concluded at around 1500 hours. SCSO Criminalist Karyn Crawford, and 
Autopsy Technicians Michelle Novak and Isabella Rotti were assisting. Monterey County District 
Attorney Investigative Aide (DAIA) Tanya Nava and DAIA Vanessa Valle were in attendance. 
Nava, Valle, and I witnessed the autopsy from a viewing room adjoined to the autopsy suite. We 
viewed the autopsy suite directly through a glass partition and electronically via closed circuit 
television monitoring. The rooms were equipped with two-way communication via an intercom 
system. 
 
I observed the decedent in a white body bag labeled as “Anthony Tovar” and sealed with bag lock 
#85571. I witnessed Criminalist Crawford taking photographs to document the postmortem 
examination. I witnessed Criminalist Crawford and Technician Novak collect the following items 
of evidence during the autopsy:

SCHUMACHEREP 
On 8-08-23, at approximately 2130 HRS, deputies were dispatched to-Hyland Dr, 
Salinas. The RP, 
stated there was a male subject insTcle'his residence. 
The male was in a bedroom, with 
The male was armed with 
a knife. 
At approximately 2135 HRS, SGT D GONZALEZ, FTO RAMIREZ, Deputy C PANTOJA, 
and Deputy J PEREZ arrived on scene. 
At approximately 2136 HRS, radio traffic advising ""shots fired"" was put out. 
Deputy SOTO and I responded from the area of Highway 1 and Merritt St, Castroville. 
We responded with emergency lights and siren. 
VVhile en route to the incident, I assumed the role of Patrol Supervisor, as the only on 
duty supervisor was involved in the incident. 
I contacted Commander N DAVIS, via cellular telephone, advised of the deputies 
involved in a shooting, and stated more information would be provided as soon as I 
arrived on scene. 
At approximately 2147 HRS, upon arrival on scene, I advised Deputy SOTO to start a 
crime scene log and establish the entry/exit point at the intersection of El Rancho Way 
and Hyland Dr, Salinas. 
I then contacted SGT GONZALEZ, who was standing out in front of the residence. 
I confirmed SGT GONZALEZ had no injuries and obtained a Public Safety Statement. 
SGT GONZALEZ stated he fired 1 round from his department-issued Glock 17M. When 
the suspect did not react to this, he fired 2, or possibly 3, more rounds from his handgun. 
SGT GONZALEZ stated there were no outstanding subjects, no other persons were

I then entered the residence, where I found Salinas Fire personnel, as well as AMR 
Medical personnel, providing medical treatment to the male subject. 
I checked on FTO RAMIREZ and Deputy C PANTOJA. Both advised they had no 
injuries. 
FTO RAMIREZ stated he did not engage the subject, as Deputy PANTOJA and SGT 
GONZALEZ were positioned in front of him at the time of the incident. 
I then spoke with Deputy PANTOJA. 
I obtained a Public Safety Statement from Deputy PANTOJA. 
Deputy PANTOJA stated he fired 1 round from his department-issued Glock 17M. 
Deputy PANTOJA stated there were no outstanding subjects, no other persons were 
injured, and the incident occurred in the bedroom. 
After speaking with SGT GONZALEZ and Deputy PANTOJA, it was apparent there was 
no longer any threat to the residents, deputies, or the general public. The incident was 
contained to the bedroom, inside the residence. There were no outstanding suspects, 
and all involved parties were accounted for. 
Several minutes later, FTO MEILAN and Deputy M BROWN arrived on scene. 
I had them relieve FTO RAMIREZ and stand by in the bedroom for scene security. 
Deputy PANTOJA was then placed in a marked patrol vehicle with Deputy J PEREZ, 
who stated he was not involved in the incident. 
SGT GONZALEZ was placed in a marked patrol vehicle with Deputy ROMERO. 
FTO RAMIREZ was placed in a marked patrol vehicle with Deputy MORAN.

I advised the involved deputies to contact their family/significant others to tell them they 
were involved in a critical incident and that they were safe. They were advised to not talk 
to anyone about the incident, whether it was family, or other law enforcement officers. 
SGT GONZALEZ, FTO RAMIREZ and Deputy PANTOJA were then taken to the Central 
Patrol Station, Salinas. 
The mother and child had already been removed from the residence and were secured 
in a patrol vehicle. 
A short time later, Commander N DAVIS and Commander J SMITH arrived on the 
scene. 
Both were briefed and provided with as much information as possible. 
At the lime, the identity of the subject was unknown. He did look familiar, but I could not 
recall his name at the time. I did recall him being contacted while investigating a sexual 
assault at a residence across the street, down an alleyway. I could not recall the address 
but did recall contacting him while assisting with that case. 
This information was later passed on to investigators. 
None of the involved deputies were able to identify the male. 
Monterey County District Attorney's Office Investigators arrived on the scene, as well as 
detectives from the Monterey County Sheriff's Office. 
Scene security was maintained by Monterey County Sheriff's Office deputies, as well as 
Salinas Police Officers. 
The investigation was taken over by the Monterey County District Attorney's Office 
Investigators. 
Nothing further from this deputy at this lime. 
Case continued with Monterey County District Attorney's Office.

residence. 
Once I was inside the residence, I saw SFD and AMR personnel treating a victim in a rear 
bedroom. At 2202 hours, SFD announced the time of death which was approved by Dr.

On August 8th, 2023, at approximately 2152 hours I received a phone call from Deputy 
S. Moran. Deputy Moran infom,ed me that there was a deputy-involved shooting at an 
unknown location and he was responding. I was currently the on-call Detective Sergeant 
for the violent crime's unit of investigations. I contacted investigations Commander 
Jason Smith and notified him of what had occurre!=f. 
I then contacted dispatch. I was informed that the shooting happened at -Hyland 
Drive, Salinas. I then contacted the on-call detectives Daniel Hopkins, and Jesus Reyes. 
Both began their response to the scene. I then contacted senior homicide detective 
Arras Wilson and requested he stand by for a response. 
I was then briefed by Commander Jason Smith that the entire team would need to 
respond to the scene. I arrived at the location shortly after and met Detective Wilson and 
Detective Hopkins. We received a briefing about this incident and that the District 
Attorneys' Office would be handling the deputy-involved shooting investigation with the 
Sheriffs Office assisting with the evidence collection/identification. 
I contacted Detective Sergeant Michael Smith and requested the on-duty crime scene 
investigator {CSI) respond to the scene. CSI 
later responded to the 
scene. It was then determined that Detective Wilson and Detective Hopkins and I were 
enough personnel at the scene to assist with the CSI duties. Should be mentioned that 
Detective Hopkins and I ͢ed the basic and advanced crime scene 
investigators course. When - arrived on the scene, she was given a brief 
and escorted throughout the residence. 
then created a path for the digital 
scanner and began her work.

hours,

Det. Jeffery Squires from the Coroner's Office was contacted and later responded to the 
scene. During the removal of the decedent, Det Squires requested assistance moving 
the body due to the tight quarters where he lay. Det. A. Wilson and I assisted with the 
removal. 
The suspect was identified by Det. Hopkins. (Please see his attached supplemental 
report for further). Once the decedent was removed, all personnel began leaving the 
scene. All detectives and I signed out of the crime scene log and stayed until the scene 
was taken down. 
Nothing further from this Sergeant.

On 8/8/23, at about 2200 hours, I received a phone call from Det. Sgt. Kennedy. He 
asked me to respond to-yland Dr. in Salinas to assist with an investigation of a 
shooting. 
I arrived on scene and was informed that the Monterey County District Attorney's Office 
would be handling the investigation of the incident. I was told that they would be utilizing 
the services of the Sheriff's Office Forensic Evidence Technicians to document the 
scene and collect evidence. 
I was asked to remain on scene and assist 
s she processed the crime 
scene. 
During the investigation, a key fob with a Mercedes logo was found in the victim's 
pockets. I offered to walk the neighborhood in search of a Mercedes associated to the 
keys. 
I walked through the alley across the street from-yland Dr. with DAI Captain 
Ferreria. We located a 2001 black Mercedes (CA License Plate 7DAX938) parked in the 
alley. 
I returned to the scene and collected the key. I returned to the vehicle and the key 
unlocked the vehicle. On the front passenger seat, Cap. Ferreria found several pieces 
of mail with the name Anthony Tovar on them. 
I contacted the Monterey County Records Department and asked them to conduct a 
record check on Anthony Tovar with the approximate age range of twenty-five to thirty 
years old. They advised that they located an Anthony Tovar (7/22/98). I asked them to 
send a photo of Tovar. They emailed me a photo of Tovar and I forwarded the photo to 
Capt. Ferreria to assist with identification. 
I then remained on scene until the scene was released to the homeowner. 
Case continues.

Fatal shooting of Jason Hampton on August 6, 2023, by La Mesa Police Officer 
Brian Heller; San Diego Police Department Case No. 23-033924; DA Special 
Operations Case 23-068PS; Deputy District Attorney assigned: Kristi Gill 
Dear Chief Sweeney and Chief Wahl, 
We have reviewed the materials compiled by the San Diego Police Department's Homicide Unit 
concerning the shooting of Jason Hampton on August 6, 2023. A District Attorney Investigator 
responded to the scene and was briefed by detectives. This case was submitted to the District 
Attorney's Office for review on November 7, 2023. The Medical Examiner's Report was 
received on May 20, 2024. 
Summary 
On August 6, 2023, La Mesa Police Department (LMPD) Officer Brian Heller drove to an 
apartment complex near 8000 University A venue as part of an effort to locate Jason Hampton, 
who was known to have a felony no-bail warrant. Heller parked his marked police vehicle in the 
parking lot and observed a parked blue Chevrolet pickup truck he identified as being associated 
with Hampton. 
Heller requested another officer to assist him in contacting Hampton. Another officer arrived at 
Heller's location and parked next to Heller's vehicle. As Heller updated the officer on 
Hampton's warrant, Hampton exited the apartment complex and walked to the passenger side of 
the blue Chevrolet pickup. Heller alerted the other officer that he was going to contact Hampton. 
Hampton had opened the front passenger side door of the truck and was standing between the 
open door and the inside of the truck facing the front of the truck. Heller and the other officer 
approached the truck, Hampton walking toward the front of the truck while the other officer 
moved toward the rear of the truck. 
As Heller approached, he said, ""Hey, Jason."" Hampton looked at Heller and responded by 
voicing, ""Huh?"" Heller continued toward Hampton and inquired, ""You Jason?"" Hampton denied 

Chief Ray Sweeney 
Chief Scott Wahl 
Page 2 of9 
by stating, ""No."" Heller walked a little closer, stood directly in front of Hampton, and said, 
""Jason."" Hampton raised a handgun with his right hand and pointed it directly at Heller. Heller 
heard several clicks that were consistent with the sound of a trigger pull of a firearm. 
Heller immediately ducked behind a vehicle parked to his left and drew his Glock 45 9mm 
semiautomatic pistol. Heller saw Hampton move backward and away from the door of the truck 
while still holding the gun in his hand. Hampton's arm was outstretched and he was pointing the 
gun toward Heller. Heller fired five shots toward Hampton as Hampton ran behind several 
parked vehicles in the direction of a heavily traveled roadway. Heller chased after Hampton and 
saw that while running, Hampton was attempting to manipulate the firearm he was holding. 
Hampton, with the firearm in hand, turned back toward Heller. Heller fired four additional 
rounds at Hampton. One round struck Hampton in the back of the neck, fatally wounding him. 
Hampton fell and the firearm dropped to the ground in front of him. 
The investigation into the incident revealed that the gun Hampton had attempted to fire was 
operable, but it did not discharge because of a temporary malfunction known as a ""stovepipe"" 
malfunction. This type of malfunction occurs when a live cartridge is in the chamber, and a 
second cartridge or cartridge case becomes wedged between the slide and the firearm's ejection 
port in a perpendicular position out of the side of the firearm. 
The Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy and determined Hampton's cause of death was a 
gunshot wound and the manner of death was homicide. Toxicological testing of Hampton's 
blood was negative for alcohol or drugs. 
Persons Involved 
Jason Clark Hampton was a 41-year-old resident of La Mesa, California. At the time of the 
incident, Brian Heller had been a police officer for six years and three months. 
Civilian Witness One (CWJ) 
CWl is Hampton's former girlfriend. They had recently ended their relationship. CWl and 
Hampton shared a residence in the apartment complex but were in the process of moving out. To 
CWI 's knowledge, Hampton did not have any firearms. CWl reported that on August 6, 2023, 
she came home from running errands and Hampton left a short while later. After Hampton left, 
CWl heard some noises outside. CWl described the noises she heard as ""pops"" but stated that 
type of noise was not unusual for the area. 
Civilian Witness Two (CW2) 
CW2 lives in the same apartment complex as Hampton. On August 6, 2023, between 4:00 and 
4:30 p.m., CW2 was in his living room with his wife and young son. CW2 heard three shots he 
recognized as ""gunfire."" He then heard a second volley of approximately four to five gunshots. 
After the gunshots, CW2 and his wife looked out of their bedroom window, which faces the 
entry driveway to the apartment complex. CW2 saw two police officers standing near the top of 
the driveway. He also saw a person on the ground in front of the two officers whom he 
recognized as Hampton. He stated Hampton drove a blue Chevrolet pickup truck which was 
parked in the parking lot. CW2's vehicle was parked to the left of Hampton's truck and sustained 
damage from gunshots that were fired. 

Chief Ray Sweeney 
Chief Scott Wahl 
Page 3 of9 
Civilian Witness Three (CW3) 
CW3 lives in the same apartment complex as Hampton, and his residence was behind the parking 
spaces where the shooting incident took place. CW3 reported that on August 6, 2023, at 
approximately 4:15 p.m., he was in his living room with his wife and baby. CW3's daughter was 
in her bedroom. As CW3 and his wife watched television, CW3 heard a loud ""snap"" and a 
hanging wall calendar fell off the wall. CW3 saw smoke in the air and his lights went out. CW3 
checked the area where the calendar had been hanging and noticed a hole in the wall. CW3 
looked across the room and saw second hole in the wall directly across from the front door. CW3 
checked his daughter's room and noticed two more holes in two walls in the bedroom. When 
CW3 opened his front door to see what was going on, he noticed a fifth hole in a glass window 
panel directly across from his front door. 
Civilian Witness Four (CW4) 
CW4 was driving her vehicle westbound on University Avenue near the apartment complex. She 
stopped her vehicle near the red signal light just west of the location of the shooting, next to an 
electrical box. CW 4 heard shots. She noticed her vehicle had been struck when a piece of her 
passenger door frame or mirror flew onto the dashboard. She could smell gunpowder after the 
impact. She noted that there was some separation of time between gunfire. One of the last 
""booms"" she heard was when her vehicle was struck. CW 4 believed the shooting incident 
occurred behind her. She immediately pulled over and tried to call 911. She then drove her 
vehicle into a parking lot where she saw police officers with their guns drawn, and it appeared 
officers were handcuffing someone on the ground. 
Law Enforcement Officer One (LEJ) Jacoby 
LEI is a patrol officer with LMPD. On the afternoon of the shooting, he received a message 
from Heller requesting assistance in contacting a subject with a felony warrant. LEI drove to 
Heller's location and parked in the lot next to Heller. Heller stood outside of his police vehicle 
and briefed LEI on the subject and his felony warrant. 
Heller told LEI that he believed the suspect had just walked out of the apartment complex. 
Heller started walking toward a blue Chevrolet pickup truck so LEI got out of his police vehicle 
and walked approximately ten feet behind Heller in the same direction. LEI could see a subject, 
later identified as Hampton, standing inside the open front passenger side door of the blue 
Chevrolet pickup truck. Heller was walking toward the front of the truck, where Hampton was. 
LEI stated that at that time he did not know Hampton's name, but heard Heller ask Hampton if 
he was ""whatever name."" 
As LE 1 walked toward the back of the pickup truck, he heard two to three clicking sounds 
coming from where Hampton was standing. At that point, LEI drew his firearm and heard shots 
fired from where Heller was standing. Hampton disappeared from LEI 's view, so LEI continued 
around the rear of the blue pickup truck and followed behind Hampton as Hampton ran down a 
set of stairs away from LE 1. 
LEI asked Heller ifhe was okay, but Heller didn't answer at first. LEI saw that Hampton was 
running toward University Avenue and noted there wasn't anyone else in the area behind the 
truck where Hampton had been standing. LE 1 continued to follow Hampton. He did not see 
Hampton's hands as Hampton was running away. LEI then heard a couple more shots coming 

Chief Ray Sweeney 
Chief Scott Wahl 
Page 4 of9 
from Heller's location and saw Hampton collapse near the end of the driveway going toward 
University Avenue. 
LEI and Heller approached Hampton, who was lying on the ground. LEI saw a gun on the 
ground in front of Hampton and noted it appeared to have experienced a ""stovepipe"" 
malfunction. Heller did not know ifhe had been shot or not, so LEI checked Heller's body and 
confirmed Heller had not been shot. LE I then handcuffed Hampton for safety. An LMPD 
sergeant arrived shortly after the shooting occurred and paramedics responded to the scene and 
attempted life-saving measures. 
Officer Brian Heller 
Heller is a patrol officer and has been a member of the SWAT team for three years. On August 4, 
2023, Heller was searching for a subject with an active felony no-bail warrant, Jason Hampton. 
Heller had independently confirmed the existence of the warrant and he had viewed prior 
booking photos of Hampton to familiarize himself with Hampton's appearance. On August 4, 
Heller was unable to locate Hampton. On August 6, 2023, Heller learned that Hampton drove a 
blue Chevrolet pickup truck and Heller viewed two photos of the truck. Heller learned the truck 
was parked at an apartment complex near 8000 University A venue. 
At approximately 4:00 p.m., Heller drove to the 8000 block of University Avenue, where he saw 
the blue Chevrolet truck backed into a parking space. Heller first surveilled the apartment 
complex from a nearby shopping center, then moved to the apartment complex parking lot. He 
contacted LE 1 to request cover so that he could safely contact Hampton. When LE 1 arrived at 
the location, Heller briefed LEI on the information regarding Hampton and showed LEI a photo 
of Hampton. From the corner of his eye, Heller saw a subject who matched Hampton's booking 
photo approaching the passenger side of the blue Chevrolet pickup truck. Heller informed LE 1 
that the subject he saw was likely Hampton and they decided to approach the subject. Heller 
aired on his police radio that he would be contacting Hampton and activated his body worn 
camera. 
As Heller approached the blue pickup truck, he saw that Hampton had opened the front 
passenger door of the truck and was standing between the open door and the cab of the truck, 
facing Heller's direction. Heller said to Hampton, ""Hey Jason."" Hampton responded with, 
""Huh?"" Heller got a little closer to Hampton and said, ""You Jason?"" Hampton responded, ""No."" 
Heller was now standing directly in front of and facing Hampton, who was standing in the 
doorway of the truck. Heller again said, ""Jason."" Immediately, Hampton raised a dark-colored 
handgun and pointed the barrel directly toward Heller's center chest and face. Heller heard one 
audible ""click"" from the gun Hampton was holding. Heller knew this was consistent with the 
trigger being pulled. Heller was terrified seeing the gun pointed at him. He instinctively ducked 
down to his left to take cover behind the rear of the vehicle parked next to the truck and drew his 
firearm. As Heller ducked down, he heard approximately three to five more audible clicks. 
Heller knew, based on his training and experience, the clicking sound indicated a significant 
weapon misfire. 
After Heller drew his own firearm, his view of Hampton was obscured by the open door of the 
truck. Heller fully stood up and pointed his gun in the direction of where Hampton was last

standing. Heller could see Hampton swiftly walking back behind other vehicles and then moving 
toward University Avenue. Heller could see Hampton was holding something in front of himself 
toward the center of his waistband. Heller described Hampton's gait as ""awkward"" and that it 
seemed Hampton was more focused on what he was doing with the gun in his hands than on 
running away. 
Heller believed Hampton was attempting to manipulate the firearm so that it would be operable, 
so he fired at Hampton, using a parked vehicle as partial cover. Heller fired several shots in 
Hampton's direction. After Heller stopped firing, he realized Hampton had run down a set of 
stairs and his view of Hampton was blocked by a van. Heller completely lost sight of Hampton 
as Hampton ran southbound toward University A venue. 
Heller was aware there was a nearby pedestrian crosswalk and just across University A venue, a 
shopping center. Knowing this to be a very busy roadway with a high volume of foot and vehicle 
traffic, Heller was concerned about the danger to the public. Heller took a cover position at the 
front passenger side comer of a van parked in the lot, so that he would have readily available 
cover if needed. Hampton reemerged from the stairwell into Heller's view. Heller could see 
Hampton still had the firearm in his hands in front of his body. Heller was concerned Hampton 
would try again to shoot him or would shoot another individual in the area and inflict serious 
bodily injury or death. 
As Hampton continued to run southbound through the parking lot, he partially turned toward 
Heller. Heller could see the dark-colored semiautomatic handgun in Hampton's right hand. 
Heller was afraid Hampton had cleared the malfunction on the weapon and was turning toward 
him, prepared to fire again. Heller fired four additional rounds toward Hampton, one of which 
appeared to have struck Hampton. Hampton fell face forward. Heller estimated that, in total, he 
fired six to eight shots. 
The firearm Hampton was holding fell out in front of him. LEI emerged from the same staircase 
that Hampton had gone down. LEI asked if Heller had been shot and Heller asked LEI to check 
him to make sure he was okay. Heller then aired ""shots fired"" and requested medics. Heller was 
unsure if Hampton had fired his weapon or ifhe had been hit. Once a patrol sergeant arrived at 
the scene, Heller and LE I approached Hampton and secured him so that medics could respond 
and provide life-saving measures. 
Heller took photographs of the scene, including of Hampton's firearm on the ground as it was 
when Hampton dropped it. Heller put on a pair of gloves, retrieved the firearm, rendered it safe, 
and stored it in the patrol sergeant's vehicle for investigators. Heller noticed the magazine was 
partially ejected out of the firearm and that there was one unexpended round in the chamber. The 
chamber was stuck in the open position on a second unexpended round that was horizontal to the 
chamber with the bullet portion of the round facing to the right. Heller described the condition of 
the gun as having experienced a combination of a double feed and a ""stovepipe"" malfunction. 
Heller believed Hampton had attempted to kill him. Hampton had pointed his firearm directly at 
Heller and pulled the trigger multiple times. Heller felt he had no option other than to use lethal 
force because that was the level of force he was confronted with when Hampton pointed the

Chief Scott Wahl 
Page 6 of9 
firearm at him and pulled the trigger. In addition, Heller was concerned about the serious public 
safety risk that Hampton posed. 
Body Worn Camera Evidence 
Heller and LEI were equipped with body worn cameras and both cameras were activated during 
the incident. Heller's camera best captured the interaction preceding the shooting incident as LE I 
was behind Heller during their initial approach toward Hampton. LEI 's footage captured his 
pursuit of Hampton between parked cars and the buildings in the apartment complex while 
Heller's footage captured his pursuit of Hampton through the parking lot in front of parked cars. 
Heller's camera footage shows Heller walk from his police vehicle to approach Hampton. 
Hampton is seen standing on the passenger side of the pickup truck between the open passenger 
door and the cab of the truck. Heller is heard saying, ""Hey Jason."" Hampton is captured looking 
directly at Heller and responding, ""Huh?"" Heller continues to approach Hampton and asks, ""You 
Jason?"" to which Hampton responds, ""No."" Heller is positioned in front of the hood of the 
pickup truck and appears to be approximately ten feet in front of Hampton. Heller says, ""Jason,"" 
and Hampton immediately raises a black handgun and points it toward Heller. Heller drops down 
to his left, moves behind a gold-colored vehicle parked next to the blue pickup truck, and draws 
his firearm. Heller fires five rounds toward Hampton as Hampton runs southbound out of view. 
Moments later, Hampton can be seen emerging from behind a concrete retaining wall into 
Heller's view. Hampton is running in the direction of University Avenue but turns toward Heller. 
Heller fires four rounds at Hampton, and Hampton falls to the ground. LE I emerges from behind 
the same concrete retaining wall and asks Heller if he is alright. LE I checks Heller to determine 
ifhe has been stuck by gunfire, and Heller performs a tactical reload of his firearm. Heller 
camera continues to record as Heller photographs and secures Hampton's firearm while LEI 
handcuffs Hampton. The two officers then wait for medics to respond. 
LEI 's body worn camera shows him walking behind Heller as they approach a blue Chevrolet 
pickup truck. After Heller's initial interaction with Hampton, Heller is seen ducking down to the 
ground in front of the blue truck. Several ""clicks"" can be heard. LE I draws his firearm and 
points it in the direction of the rear of the blue truck. At the same time, several shots are heard. 
Next, Hampton is captured running down a set of concrete stairs, holding a gun in his right hand. 
LEI broadcasts ""shots fired"" over the police radio and then asks Heller if he is alright. Four more 
shots are heard as LEI follows Hampton's path down the concrete stairs. When LEI emerges 
from the stairwell, Hampton is visible lying on the ground at the end of the driveway. LEI 
checks Heller for any injuries and then handcuffs Hampton. 
Investigation 
The incident took place in the city of La Mesa in a parking lot outside of an apartment complex 
in the 8000 block of University Avenue. The scene was secured, photographed, and investigated 
by the San Diego Police Department (SDPD) Homicide Unit. A complete review was conducted 
of all officers' and detectives' reports, crime scene investigators' reports, audio recorded 
interviews of civilian and law enforcement witnesses, all body worn camera footage, along with 
the Medical Examiner's autopsy report and toxicology report. The events leading up to the 
incident, and the incident itself, were captured on the officers' body worn cameras. All these 
items were found to provide evidence which corroborates the officers' statements. 

Chief Ray Sweeney 
Chief Scott Wahl 
Page 7 of9 
At the time of the incident, Heller was armed with a Glock 45, 9mm semiautomatic pistol. Heller 
reported that prior to the incident, his pistol was loaded with a total of eighteen 9mm caliber 
cartridges - seventeen rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber. Heller also carried 
on his duty belt three additional fully loaded magazines, each containing seventeen rounds. 
During the incident, Heller performed a tactical reload of his firearm, removing his partially 
loaded magazine and reloading with one of his fully loaded magazines. Following the shooting 
incident, an SDPD Crime Scene Specialist collected Heller's firearm for processing. Heller's 
firearm was received with one live cartridge in the chamber, and a fully loaded seventeen-round 
magazine seated in the firearm. A partially loaded Glock 9mm magazine was recovered from the 
scene. This magazine was loaded with eight unexpended cartridges. Heller retained two fully 
loaded seventeen-round magazines attached to his duty belt. Based on the number of rounds that 
were loaded into the pistol prior to the shooting incident, and the remaining rounds that that were 
loaded in the partially loaded Glock magazine recovered at the scene, it was determined Heller 
fired nine cartridges from his firearm. Consistent with this determination, nine 9mm casings that 
matched the ammunition in Heller's firearm were found at Heller's two shooting positions. BWC 
footage also confirmed Heller fired a total of nine rounds. 
Hampton was in possession of a loaded Springfield Armory Model XDE-9 9mm semiautomatic 
pistol. Following the shooting incident, the Crime Scene Specialist collected the pistol for 
processing and documented that the weapon held a partially seated magazine containing six live 
9mm cartridges. Photos taken at the scene confirmed there had been one live 9mm cartridge in 
the chamber, and one live 9mm cartridge wedged in between the slide and the firearm's ejection 
port in a perpendicular position out of the side of the firearm. This condition is known as a 
""stovepipe"" malfunction, which will render a firearm temporarily inoperable. All of the 
cartridges had the headstamp ""Tulammo 9mm LUGER."" Hampton's pistol was determined to be 
operable once the malfunction was cleared. A record check of the pistol revealed that previously 
it had been reported stolen. 
An SDPD Crime Scene Specialist identified bullet holes within CW3's residence, and in two 
separate vehicles that belonged to CW2 and CW4. This is consistent with their account of what 
they observed. Bullet fragments were recovered from the residence and CW2's vehicle. No 
civilians in the vicinity were physically injured during the incident. 
Autopsy 
An autopsy was conducted on August 8, 2023. The Deputy Medical Examiner determined that 
Hampton had suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the neck. The bullet struck the carotid 
artery and fractured the cervical vertebrae as it passed through Hampton's body before it exited 
his right cheek. During the internal examination, gray metal projectile fragments was recovered 
and collected as evidence by a Forensic Evidence Technician, who was present during the 
autopsy. The cause of death was classified as a gunshot wound and the manner of death was 
classified as homicide. 
Toxicological testing was conducted on a sample of Hampton's blood. The results were negative 
for the presence of alcohol or drugs.

Legal Standard of Criminal Liability 
Penal Code section 835a(c) sets forth the circumstances in which a peace office may use deadly 
force and the standard to evaluate the use of such force. The law provides that ""a peace officer is 
justified in using deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, 
based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary to defend against an imminent 
threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person."" Penal Code section 
835a(c)(l)(A). 
The statute defines deadly force as ""any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing 
death or serious bodily injury, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm."" Penal 
Code section 835a(e)(l). 
An imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury is one where ""based on the totality of the 
circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the 
present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily 
injury to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future 
harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one 
that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed."" Penal Code section 
835a( e )(2). 
The statute defines totality of the circumstances as ""all facts known to the peace officer at the 
time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force."" 
Penal Code section 835a(e)(3). 
The statue further states, ""In determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall 
evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case, and shall use other 
available resources and techniques, if reasonably safe and feasible to an objectively reasonable 
officer."" Penal Code section 835a(2). 
""[T]he decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a 
reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or 
perceived by the officer at the time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight. The totality of 
circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments 
about using force."" Penal Code section 835a(4). 
Conclusion 
Officer Heller knew Jason Hampton had an outstanding no-bail felony warrant when he located 
and attempted to contact Hampton in the parking lot of an apartment complex. Heller called out 
to Hampton, who was standing behind the open front passenger side door. Hampton denied being 
the subject Heller was looking for. When Heller got to the front of the truck, approximately ten 
feet from Hampton, Hampton suddenly pulled out a handgun, pointed it directly at Heller's upper 
body, and quickly pulled the trigger several times. The loaded gun did not fire due to what was 
later determined to be a ""stovepipe"" malfunction of the gun. But for the malfunction, the loaded 
firearm was otherwise operable. Heller instinctively ducked down, drew his firearm, and 
returned fire in Hampton's direction. Hampton fled. While running, Hampton continued to 
manipulate the firearm he held in his right hand. He was headed toward University A venue, an 
area with a high volume of pedestrian and vehicle traffic, when he turned toward Heller. Heller 

Chief Ray Sweeney 
Chief Scott Wahl
Page 9 of 9
fired four additional rounds, one of which struck Hampton, causing Hampton to fall and drop the 
firearm. 
Hampton's actions made it clear he intended to evade Officer Heller and that he was willing to 
shoot Heller in order to achieve that end. When Officer Heller discharged his firearm, he 
reasonably believed that the use of deadly force was necessary to defend against the imminent 
threat of death or serious bodily injury that Hampton posed. A reasonable officer in the same 
situation would believe that Hampton had the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to 
immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. 
Therefore, Heller bears no state criminal liability for his actions. A copy of this letter, along with 
the materials submitted for our review will be retained in our files.

ANALYSIS 
 
On July 4th, 2023, you were involved in a mutual domestic battery.  This incident was investigated by the 
Grass Valley Police Dept. At that time it was determined that you were
told officers that the two of you were engaged and were living 
together. During that investigation you lied to GVPD Officer Fish about how you sustained your visible 
injuries.  You also lied to officers about your participation in the incident when you told them it was only a 
verbal argument. You told GVPD Officers your visible injuries were from tripping and falling. It was also 
noted that you initially identified yourself as an employee of the Sheriff’s Office, and you admitted you 
were under the influence of alcohol. It was also noted that you were heard talking on your phone during the 
detention, and were recorded telling someone about the incident, and you commented that you were “so 
fired”. Your statements were recorded on multiple Grass Valley Police Officers body worn cameras 
(BWCs). 
 
During the Grass Valley Police investigation of the July 4th incident, they learned that a citizen had recorded 
your altercation on a cell phone, and they obtained a copy of the video recording.  In the recording you can 
been seen walking after your boyfriend on a public sidewalk. As he is walking away from you, he stops and 
then two of you start arguing again. While he is standing in front of you, you abruptly hit him across his 
face. He then subsequently grabs you and throws you onto the ground.  In watching the video, it was clear 
the statements you made to the officers regarding how you sustained the injuries to your hands and knees 
was a lie.  It was also very clear that when you told Officer Fish it was only a verbal argument, that too was 
a lie.  In watching the video recording, it was clear that at that moment you were the dominant aggressor. 
Your recorded comment that evening about being “fired” and your knowledge about what you had done 
during the argument provides sufficient motivation for you to lie. 
 
On July 4th you had the option of telling the truth, remaining silent, or simply telling the responding officers 
you did not want to provide a statement. Instead, you chose to knowingly provide false information. As a 
person who had been a Correctional Officer for over two years, and also having earned a degree in 
Administration of Justice, you should have known that providing false information is absolutely 
unacceptable. 
 
On July 22nd, 2023, (18 days later) a disturbance at your residence was reported to the Sheriff’s Office.  You 
were contacted at your residence and were found inside with an injury to your head and other parts of your 
body.  On the evening of this event, and when questioned later by investigators, you told them that you did 
not know how you sustained your injuries.  You also claimed you didn’t not know who caused your injuries.  
It was later learned that while you were seeking treatment for your injuries, you had sent messages to a 
coworker naming your boyfriend 
as the person that was responsible for your injuries.  
Again, instead of telling the truth, remaining silent, or telling law enforcement officers you did not wish to 
make a statement, you defaulted to providing a false statement. It is also noted that you were under the 
influence of alcohol during this incident.

CONCLUSION 
 
, and knowingly provide 
false information on multiple occasions, is a violation of state law, Sheriff’s Office Policy, Nevada 
County Policies, and the Local 39 MOU.   
 
Sheriff’s Office employees have always, and will always, be held to a greater standard. This is further 
evidenced by the strict Sheriff’s Office hiring standards and a pre-employment background process, which 
is not required by other positions located outside the Sheriff’s Office.  If you had these types of sustained 
violations in your background, prior to your employment with the Sheriff’s Office, you would not have 
been selected to be a Correctional Officer. Additionally, had you been convicted in a criminal court of 
domestic violence, you would not be allowed to be in possession of firearms, which is an essential part of 
your jobs function. I recognize that Sheriff’s Office employees do not have to be perfect, but they must 
strive to be excellent. 
 
A Correctional Officer’s job is a position of respect and trust. All Sheriff’s Office employees are held to 
the highest standards of behavior.  Honesty and credibility are crucial to proper performance of your 
duties. Dishonesty in matters of public trust is intolerable. Your documented and lengthy pattern of 
deliberate deception, toward coworkers, supervisors, investigators, and outside law enforcement is 
irrefutable. Dishonesty is not an isolated act; it is more a continuing trait of character. False statements, 
misrepresentations and omissions regarding official matters are likely to result in harm to public service, 
the public’s trust in law enforcement and irreparable harm to the reputation of the Sheriff’s Office and its 
employees.
