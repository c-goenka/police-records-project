It appeared each deputy was trying to gain control of Maradiaga as he physically thrashing his body around causing the deputies to use controlling force. I was later informed that Deputy Valenzuela had to utilize closed fist strikes to gain compliance as well as in self defense. For more information, please reference Deputy Valenzuela, Deputy Ordonez, Corporal Uson, and Deputy McAnanys Officer Reports. As I arrived and assessed where I could assist, Corporal Wanzer also arrived on scene and instructed the deputies involved to remove Maradiaga from the elevator. In response, I grabbed Maradiagas right arm with both of my hands and, with a pulling motion, pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator with the assistance of the other involved deputies. Once out of Elevator 3 and in the incarcerated person well on his stomach, Maradiaga continued to resist by thrashing about and tensing his body. While maintaining grip on Maradiagas right arm, Corporal Wanzer took control of Maradiagas right arm, allowing me to apply downward pressure on Maradiagas upper back region to suppress his efforts of thrashing about. Corporal Wanzer then guided Maradiagas right hand towards me, allowing me to place both of his hands in handcuffs because Maradiagas left hand was now also behind his back. With Maradiaga now in handcuffs, another deputy was able to secure Maradiaga in leg chains. Had I not used force, we would not have been able to place Maradiaga in restraints. Once Maradiaga was placed into handcuffs and leg chains, deputies lifted him onto the gurney, and was secured to the gurney via the affixed gurney straps. Maradiaga was then escorted to the 2nd Floor Strip Search room and medically evaluated by Nurse . Nurse treated Maradiagas injuries and cleared him to be housed. Deputy Getnet 4549 took photos of all visible injuries that Maradiaga sustained. Sgt. Applebaum 3075 took photos of Deputy Valenzuelas visible injuries before Deputy Valenzuela went to the hospital for treatment. Deputy Crist 3604 from Classification arrived on scene shortly after and interviewed Maradiaga and determined he would be housed on the 5th Floor with a classification code of level 5. Deputy Crist also informed me that Maradiaga would now be dressed in Dayglow Green Clothing to indicate his assaultive status.

Due to the previous use of force and assaultive behavior, Maradiaga remained in leg chains and handcuffs as I utilized sheers to remove his clothing. Maradiaga was placed into Dayglow Green Jail Clothing as an indication of his assaultive behavior. Maradiaga was then secured back onto the gurney and escorted to the 5th Floor. Once on the 5th Floor, Maradiaga was removed from the gurney and placed on the floor of 5D . Corporal Wanzer, Deputy McAnany, Deputy Ordonez, Deputy Delgado, and I entered the cell with Maradiaga to safely remove his restraints. As I removed the handcuffs from Maradiagas left wrist, Corporal Wanzer attempted to guide Maradiagas left hand under his stomach and ordered him not to move. Deputy Delgado then entered the cell to articulate the orders in Spanish to help Maradiaga understand the orders better. However, despite the instructions given to Maradiaga, he disobeyed the order and attempted to free his hand from under his stomach. To suppress Maradiagas efforts of resistance, I applied downward pressure with both hands to Maradiagas upper back region. My force was effective as Corporal Wanzer was able to secure Maradiagas left hand under his stomach. Maradiagas handcuffs and leg chains were removed, and all parties safely exited the cell without further incident. Had I not pushed Maradiagas upper back, we would not have been able to exit the cell safely. In total, Maradiaga was on the gurney for approximately 30 minutes. Sgt. Cardoza 3223 was the designated safety officer for the duration of the gurney escort. On 02/25/2024, I went to the 5th Floor and had Deputy Delgado 0186 translate and read Maradiagas Miranda Rights verbatim from a deputy-issued notebook. Maradiaga responded yes to question number one and yes to question number two. Deputy Delgado asked Maradiaga what happened in the elevator, and he essentially said the following. STATEMENTS: (Statement of Maradiaga, Jose) When asked what happened, Maradiaga essentially said he was arguing with the Deputy and that he was attacked and didnt do anything wrong. Deputy Delgado asked him if he had anything relevant to the situation he wanted to tell me, but Maradiaga said no. Based on Maradiaga having no other statements to add, I ended my conversation with Maradiaga. INVESTIGATION CONTINUED: On 2/25/2024, I was informed that Deputy Valenzuela sustained abrasions to both knees, redness to his face, swelling on his right pinky finger, and a scratch to his left shoulder region. I also called the 3rd Floor Clinics area. I was informed by Nurse Practitioner that Maradiaga sustained a deviated nasal septum and bruising to his left eye and went to the hospital for treatment. Maradiaga returned from the hospital and was placed back in 5D . Based on the above information, Maradiaga will be charged with (b)(6)(A (b)(6)(C) (b)(6)(A San Diego County Sheriffs Department Arrest/Juvenile Contact Report 6 Page 6 of 7 Case No. 24107659 CAD Event No.: E9081221 Case Disposition: Arrest Primary Victim: VALENZUELA, Deputy Report No. 24107659.1 Reporting Officer Division / Organization Reviewed By SH4534 - WELDON, JOHN San Diego Central Jail SH3223 - CARDOZA, CESAR Report Date Detective Assigned Reviewed Date 2/24/2024 5:17:39 PM SH0814 - MARTINEZ, 053715 02/27/2024 14:08:24 NetRMS_CASDCR.rtf v11-15-06 Printed By SH2821 Printed: March 5, 2024 - 3:13 PM PC 69 (A) Obstruct/ Resist Executive Officer With Serious Injury and PC 243 (C)(2) Battery On a Peace Or Police Officer.

ORIGIN: On 02/24/24, I was assigned to work the 2nd Floor Search Medical Screening Deputy position at the San Diego Central Jail (SDCJ). At approximately 1545 hours, I heard traffic over the radio there was an active use of force involving a deputy and an IP inside the elevator on the 2nd Floor. I immediately ran to the elevator well to assist. BACKGROUND: Maradiaga, Jose (BN 24707521) is currently in custody for INVESTIGATION: Upon arrival to the 2nd Floor elevator well, I observed Deputy Valenzuela, Deputy Ordonez 2545, Deputy McAnany 4060, and Corporal Uson 3452 physically struggling with an incarcerated person later identified as Maradiaga, Jose (BN24707521) on the floor of Elevator 3. It appeared each deputy was trying to gain control of Maradiaga as he physically thrashing his body around causing the deputies to use controlling force. I was later informed that Deputy Valenzuela had to utilize closed fist strikes to gain compliance as well as in self defense. For more information, please reference Deputy Valenzuela, Deputy Ordonez, Corporal Uson, and Deputy McAnanys Officer Reports. As I arrived and assessed where I could assist, Corporal Wanzer also arrived on scene and instructed the deputies involved to remove Maradiaga from the elevator. In response, I grabbed Maradiagas right arm with both of my hands and, with a pulling motion, pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator with the assistance of the other involved deputies. Once out of Elevator 3 and in the incarcerated person well on his stomach, Maradiaga continued to resist by thrashing about and tensing his body. While maintaining grip on Maradiagas right arm, Corporal Wanzer took control of Maradiagas right arm, allowing me to apply downward pressure on Maradiagas upper back region to suppress his efforts of thrashing about. Corporal Wanzer then guided Maradiagas right hand towards me, allowing me to place both of his hands in handcuffs because Maradiagas left hand was now also behind his back. With Maradiaga now in handcuffs, another deputy was able to secure Maradiaga in leg chains. Had I not used force, we would not have been able to place Maradiaga in restraints.

Deputy Getnet 4549 took photos of all visible injuries that Maradiaga sustained. Sgt. Applebaum 3075 took photos of Deputy Valenzuelas visible injuries before Deputy Valenzuela went to the hospital for treatment. Deputy Crist 3604 from Classification arrived on scene shortly after and interviewed Maradiaga and determined he would be housed on the 5th Floor with a classification code of level 5. Deputy Crist also informed me that Maradiaga would now be dressed in Dayglow Green Clothing to indicate his assaultive status. Once Maradiaga was done being medically and mentally assessed, he was removed from the gurney. Due to the previous use of force and assaultive behavior, Maradiaga remained in leg chains and handcuffs as I utilized sheers to remove his clothing. Maradiaga was placed into Dayglow Green Jail Clothing as an indication of his assaultive behavior. Maradiaga was then secured back onto the gurney and escorted to the 5th Floor. Once on the 5th Floor, Maradiaga was removed from the gurney and placed on the floor of 5D . Corporal Wanzer, Deputy McAnany, Deputy Ordonez, Deputy Delgado, and I entered the cell with Maradiaga to safely remove his restraints. As I removed the handcuffs from Maradiagas left wrist, Corporal Wanzer attempted to guide Maradiagas left hand under his stomach and ordered him not to move. Deputy Delgado then entered the cell to articulate the orders in Spanish to help Maradiaga understand the orders better. However, despite the instructions given to Maradiaga, he disobeyed the order and attempted to free his hand from under his stomach. To suppress Maradiagas efforts of resistance, I applied downward pressure with both hands to Maradiagas upper back region. My force was effective as Corporal Wanzer was able to secure Maradiagas left hand under his stomach. Maradiagas handcuffs and leg chains were removed, and all parties safely exited the cell without further incident. Had I not pushed Maradiagas upper back, we would not have been able to exit the cell safely. In total, Maradiaga was on the gurney for approximately 30 minutes. Sgt. Cardoza 3223 was the designated safety officer for the duration of the gurney escort. On 02/25/2024, I went to the 5th Floor and had Deputy Delgado 0186 translate and read Maradiagas Miranda Rights verbatim from a deputy-issued notebook. Maradiaga responded yes to question number one and yes to question number two. Deputy Delgado asked Maradiaga what happened in the elevator, and he essentially said the following. STATEMENTS: (Statement of Maradiaga, Jose) When asked what happened, Maradiaga essentially said he was arguing with the Deputy and that he was attacked and didnt do anything wrong. Deputy Delgado asked him if he had anything relevant to the situation he wanted to tell me, but Maradiaga said no. Based on Maradiaga having no other statements to add, I ended my conversation with Maradiaga.

DEPUTYS OBSERVATIONS AND ACTIONS: At approximately 1543 hours, contacted Maradiaga in Transfer Holding 10 on the 1st Floor of SDCJ. Maradiaga needed to be escorted to the 2nd Floor to continue the booking process. In my prior contacts with Maradiaga during safety checks and meal servings, Maradiaga was compliant with my instructions. opened the cell door slightly to evaluate Maradiagas compliance. Maradiaga appeared compliant, and escorted him out of the cell. To maintain control of Maradiaga, grabbed hold of Maradiagas arm and guided him to the 1st Floor IP elevator well. At approximately 1545 hours, escorted Maradiaga into Elevator 3. Once inside the elevator, Maradiaga immediately attempted to turn his body towards me. To prevent Maradiaga from facing me, pushed Maradiaga into the elevator wall using both hands on his upper back and arm. The force was ineffective as Maradiaga continued to push himself off the wall and face me. gave Maradiaga numerous commands to stop, which he refused. After Maradiaga continued not to follow my instructions and attempted to face me, determined would place him in handcuffs to control him. ordered Maradiaga to put his hands behind his back, but he refused. As grabbed Maradiagas right arm and attempted to pull it behind his back, Maradiaga suddenly cocked his right elbow back in my direction to strike me. Simultaneously, Maradiaga turned his body toward me. Due to Maradiagas assaultive behavior, utilizing both of my hands to Maradiagas upper body, pulled him and took him to the floor of the elevator.

To gain control of Maradiagas head, I applied downward pressure with both hands to the right side of his face. The force was ineffective as Maradiaga rolled onto his back. As Maradiaga rolled onto his back, I immediately felt him strike me with a closed fist, which contacted my face. Simultaneously, I felt Maradiaga attempt to wrap his legs around mine. While Maradiaga began to assault me, I was in a locked elevator with no immediate assistance from deputies. While in motion, the elevator cannot open manually and must be opened by the Central Command Center (CCC). To defend myself from Maradiagas attack, I delivered three (3) closed-fist strikes with my right hand to Maradiagas face. As I struck Maradiaga, he continued to strike me, kick me, and begin to pull the shoulder area of my duty vest towards his body. As he attacked me, I felt Maradiagas fists or elbows contact my face and upper body several times. Fearing for my safety, being in a locked elevator, Maradiaga retaliating and continuing to strike me, I struck Maradiaga approximately eleven (11) additional times with my right fist. At this time, the elevator arrived on the 2nd Floor, and the door was opened. Deputy Ordonez 2545 entered the elevator and assisted me (See Deputy Ordonezs Officer Report). Maradiaga continued to attempt to assault me by trying to strike me with his fists. Additionally, I observed Maradiaga also attempt to assault Deputy Ordonez. Maradiaga rolled himself onto his right side and continued to ignore numerous orders from deputies to stop resisting. Due to Maradiagas continued assaultive behavior, I delivered a knee strike with my right knee to Maradiagas buttocks area. The force was ineffective as Maradiaga continued to attempt to strike my partners and I. Because of Maradiagas continued assaultive behavior and attempts to injure me, I delivered approximately four (4) additional closed-fist strikes to Maradiagas head area, which were ineffective. The use of force and attack from Maradiaga occurred inside the elevator. Due to the elevator being a small, confined space, Maradiaga was holding onto my duty vest and continuing to attack me; I could not disengage to assess other force options or remove myself to transition to a different force option on my duty belt. Additional deputies arrived on scene and pulled Maradiaga out of the elevator and into the 2nd Floor IP elevator well. Despite additional deputies arriving on scene, Maradiaga continued to resist deputies by not following our orders, attempting to grab onto deputies, and thrashing his body around. Because of his continued assaultive behavior, I delivered approximately two more (2) knee strikes with my right knee to Maradiagas buttocks. To gain pain compliance from Maradiaga, I applied a bent wrist lock to Maradiagas left hand with my hands. Simultaneously, I applied downward pressure, utilizing my left knee to Maradiagas buttocks. The force was effective as Maradiaga slowly began to comply with instructions. Had we not used force, Maradiaga may have continued to assault my partners or me. Eventually, deputies were able to gain complete control of Maradiaga and place him in handcuffs. Once a medical gurney arrived on scene, I supported Maradiagas legs and assisted him onto the medical gurney. Maradiaga was placed in the prone position, and the safety straps were secured. Once Maradiaga was secured on the medical gurney, I removed myself from the scene to assess my injuries and had no further contact with him. Immediately, I felt pain and observed swelling in my right pinky finger, pain on the side of my right hand, pain and scrapes to both of my knees, pain in my face, and burning to my chest area. Due to the injuries I sustained from Maradiagas attack, I was sent to the hospital for treatment. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) footage of this incident was captured.

Due to his size and agitated state I felt I would need at least another deputy to reason and escort Anderson to court holding in order to avoid any potential issues. At approximately 0400 hours Deputies Sosa 3509, Castillo 4897, and Rondero-Rojo 4336, and I entered House 1B Module to speak to Anderson about his court refusal. To see if Anderson would react differently to another Deputy I stepped to the side and let Deputy Sosa speak to Anderson. Deputy Sosa let Anderson know it was time to go to court. Anderson complied with Deputy Sosas instruction but was groaning and mumbling incoherent words. The muscles in his face were tense and his face was red. Anderson put on his jail issued blues and stated, I dont know why you guys are fucking making me do this, I dont want to go to fucking court. Deputy Sosa explained to him it is a part of jail operations and we are doing our job. Deputy Sosa convinced him to leave the quad. Anderson walked out of the module on his own with his cane. We escorted Anderson outside of the module. Once we arrived at the House Corridor he stopped walking, turned around and faced me and said, I dont have to go to fucking court. I told him to face away and keep walking or else I would place him in handcuffs for not obeying my instructions. Anderson complied. He turned around and walked down towards GBDF Processing. During our escort to GBDF Processing, Anderson said Youre a bitch for this. He continued cursing specifically at me and called me a bitch a couple more times. Once we arrived at Processing, Deputy Sosa instructed Anderson to face the wall and stop talking, while we determined which holding cell he would be secured in. Anderson ignored Deputy Sosas instructions and turned to face me. Anderson tensed up his body and said, You aint nothing but a bitch. After that he took a bladed stance, stared at me and said, Take off your badge and lets see what youre about. I instructed him to turn around and face the wall. Anderson then quickly raised his arms with closed fists and lunged towards me with his upper body as if he was going to attack me. In order to prevent Anderson from assaulting me I delivered an elbow strike to his face. I saw that Anderson raised his arms and I felt he might try to strike me. To stop him from doing this I delivered two closed fist strikes to his face. The first strike was with my left hand and the next one was with my right hand on the left side of his face. Deputies Sosa and Castillo grabbed Anderson by an arm on each side. I grabbed Anderson on the back of the neck and shoulder area. I applied downward pressure to push him to the floor. I gave verbal commands to stop resisting as I felt his body tense up as I pushed him to the floor. My force was successful in preventing Anderson from assaulting me or any of the other deputies present. We were able to force Anderson onto the floor. Once on the floor Anderson was compliant. Deputies Mccullen 3124 Enciso 6191 Denison 3743 and Calderon 4384, who were assigned to Processing were present during the incident. Deputies Mccullen and Enciso handcuffed Anderson. Anderson continued to be compliant. At approximately 0410 hours, Sgt. Romero 7800 arrived on scene and was informed about the incident. GBDF Health staff and a gurney was requested to processing. Once they arrived, Deputies Mccullen, Calderon, and Denison assisted Anderson onto the gurney. Anderson rolled himself to his side. Deputy McCullen took hold of Andersons left arm and Deputy Denison took hold of Andersons right arm and assisted him to his feet. Once Anderson was on his feet, he sat on the gurney. Deputy Calderon grabbed Andersons right shoulder and helped Anderson slide higher on the gurney as he was in the seated position. Deputy McCullen was the safety deputy during the escort to medical. Deputies Do 0361 and Robledo 4453, who were assigned to GBDF Medical escorted Anderson to the GBDF Medical where he was evaluated and treated by GBDF Health staff. Anderson was then transported to the Alvarado Hospital via Ambulance for further evaluation and treatment. At 0500 hours, I went to Concentra Urgent Care for evaluation and was treated for my injured right thumb. I had no further contact with Anderson. At approximately 0500 hours on 10/28/2023 I uploaded the digital photographs and CCTV footage of the incident onto a compact disc for evidence. I submitted all related evidence into GBDF Evidence locker 12.

The footage was uploaded to the secure server and annotated. has generated a violent history during his time at Santa Rita Jail, particularly one assault on staff witnessed prior to this incident (23-006020). During this incident, I demonstrated his ability to assault and batter staff unrestrained and after being restrained. It is without doubt is a sophisticated threat at Santa Rita Jail. It appears Santa Rita Jail has become unfit or unsafe for due to the following reports that have been written in relation to PC 240-Assault (1 report) PC 243(b)-Battery on a peace officer (4 reports) PC 242-battery (5 reports) PC 148(a)(1)-Obstruct/delay/resist a peace officer (4 reports) PC 594-Vandalism (3 reports) PC 69-Battery on peace officer (2 reports) On Monday, July 1, 2023, about 1500 hours, responded to Housing Unit 1 to assist in a RIM Team involving il EE was out for recreation time during a trial period not implementing his Management Plan. Prior to this trial period, MJ had to adhere to a strict Management Plan which included the wearing of restraints during recreation time. At this time, those restraints had not been placed on him due to his recent behavior. Subsequently, J became uncontrollable, hostile, threatening, and a danger to Santa Rita Jail facility, staff, and other incarcerated persons. During recreation time, JM kicked the D Pod door and shattered the glass. Once arrived at the Housing Unit, was tasked to equip the less lethal munitions.

The circumstances justifying the use of less lethal weapons systems include, but are not limited to: 1.Restoration or maintenance of order during jail or civil disturbances 2.Safely controlling non-compliant/violent persons. 3.Situations where the first line supervisor or Commanding Officer deem necessary to safely resolve the incident with a lesser potential of serious injury to citizens and deputies. As a less lethal weapons operator, I carried the following: Sting Ball Grenade, which is a is a device that delivers rubber pellets, a bright flash and sound. The Sting Ball Grenade is commonly used as a crowd management tool. The Sting Ball Grenade has an initial 1.5 second delay that initiates fuze assembly separation, followed by another .5 second delay before the blast which is sufficient to project the rubber balls in an approximate 50 foot radius. A LMT 40mm Less Lethal launcher. The LMT 40mm Less Lethal Launcher is a single shot launcher that fires standard 40mm less lethal ammunition. This ammunition varies from impact munitions, which utilize pain compliance by imparting kinetic energy into a subject, as well as chemical agents, and marking rounds. After I was equipped with the proper munitions for the RIM team, I entered C Pod and waited for the authorization for entry and deployment. Once the RIM team was assembled, they met with me at the upper C Pod passthrough door. Attempts to deescalate with went on for quite some time but subsequently failed. After enough reasonable time had passed for de-escalation, authorization was given for entry into D pod. In accordance with department General Orders 1.05, 21.01.01, and 1.21, along with the RIM team, I obtained authorization from Lieutenant J. Atienza to enter D Pod and deploy a Sting Ball Grenade to distract and gain control of the situation safely. I placed the Sting Ball Grenade at the D pod door where focused his attention. The Sting Ball Grenade was an effective deployment and appeared to distract and guide away from the damaged pod door. We executed a dynamic entry to gain access to D pod. Our primary concern was to deescalate violent behavior and detain him without further incident. I moved downstairs to the first level of the pod and accessed the LMT 40mm Less Lethal Launcher. I gave several lawful orders to get on the ground but he refused. put himself between the D/E pod wall and the D pod benches. is a sophisticated fighter and I believed he put himself in this position to help create a position of advantage for himself and disadvantage for us. knows it is easier to fight deputies in confined spaces rather than open spaces.

The RIM team moved passed me and engaged with I stood on top of a nearby table and observed him actively resist on his feet and when he was placed on the ground. was also assaultive during this time. At one point, I saw had disarmed a deputy and had complete control of an ACSO baton. Additionally, Deputy Gregoire, who was on scene, was bit by during the altercation. Deputy Gregoire vocalized the bite numerous times to alert his partners. For about two minutes, deputies had been struggling to gain control of on the ground. is a patient and intelligent fighter. Once he has the opportunity, he will quickly use any window of opportunity to assault staff. If has an unrestrained limb, he will use it to assault staff. At this point, I wanted to ensure we reduced any further risk of injury to deputies and I wanted to be incapacitated so he had absolutely no opportunity to assault staff, bite staff, or gain control of our less lethal weapons. With the amount of deputies that were attempting to overcome resistance, I was concerned about potential injuries could have sustained during the incident which included unnecessary back/neck injury and positional asphyxiation. Based on the totality of circumstances which included sophistication and his ability to assault staff on the ground, unrestrained and even restrained, I believed deploying the taser was our best option to overcome his resistance and prevent any further significant injury to him and deputies. I believed neuromuscular incapacitation which is defined as causing loss of sufficient voluntary muscle control, which prevents the subject from advancing and achieving their goal. I approached and observed the following. I noticed a deputy had vomited on It appeared the deputies, including myself, had been affected by the OC that had been deployed in the pod, prior to our arrival. We were all uncontrollably coughing and it appeared it had little to no effect on was at a position of advantage based on how we reacted to the OC deployment. This was a concern to me because I have personally witnessed capitalize on attacks towards deputies when he is given the slightest opportunity. I believed would use this advantage if he had the ability to do so. I advised I would deploy my TASER if he did not stop resisting. ignored my notification and continued to resist deputies. I had little room and not enough stand off to deploy one set of darts. Additionally, I did not want to drive stun and potentially create multiple points of contact that could be unreasonable. I believed it was the safest option to detain was to target the large muscle groups on and to deploy my TASER on his buttocks/upper thigh and upper back. The deployment was effective, but the deployment prevented him from being able to roll over and free his arms. After the TASER was deployed, deputies were able to gain control of arms and placed them behind his back. Once they were behind his back, continued to resist and pull away from the deputies.

The OIS occurred at a Calexico, CA, 92231 and involved officers from CPD. This report documents the initial notification and request for assistance by CPD to ICDA-BOI Commander (Cmdr.) O. Espino. Below is a summary of the investigative actions taken by Cmdr O. Espino. DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION: Notification: On February 21, 2024, at about 10:04 p.m., I, Cmdr. Orlando Espino, received a telephone call from CPD Chief of Police (COP) A. Orozco advising CPD was involved in an officer involved shooting and that the Imperial County District Attorneys Office was being requested to conduct the investigation. reached out to ICDA-BOI Chief Investigator Justin Matus, who instructed CPD to contact the California Department of Justice (CAL DOJ) in accordance with AB 1506. I subsequently relayed this information to COP Orozco and directed him to contact CAL DOJ, providing him with the necessary contact details. After a brief period, COP Orozco informed me that Special Agent Sean Richardson from CAL DOJ had advised him to refer the incident to ICDA. Following this, I contacted Chief Matus, Cmdr. Armstrong, and DAIs Victor Dominguez, Marco Lopez, Albert Llanas, and Rafael Peraza. Arrival: At approximately 11:00 p.m., reached the general vicinity of the Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS) and was met away from the OIS scene by COP Orozco and Sergeant (Sgt.) M. Carbajal. From my vantage point, observed CPD had secured the area with yellow tape and had assigned a CPD Ofc. to monitor the scene with a log. I then inquired about the status of the public safety statement and COP Orozco confirmed that it had been furnished to Sgt. Carbajal. He then proceeded to brief the following: Ofc. Hernandez and Sgt. Carbajal were dispatched TTD -carding a reported burglary. Upon arrival, they observed a familiar male, identified as CHRISTIAN Plancarte, whom they had encountered on multiple occasions at that location. According to COP Orozco, CHRISTIAN approached Sgt.

CPD was also aware the reporting was his elderly mother who they believed was hiding in one of the rooms inside the house. CPD also mentioned there had been restraining orders prohibiting CHRISTIAN from the residence but were not sure if they had expired or were active. As they approached the scene, they heard loud banging noises emanating from the residence, and observed CHRISTIAN violently attempting to enter the residence through the front door. Subsequently, CHRISTIAN charged towards Sgt Carbajal raising the crowbar as if it were a baseball bat, aiming to strike him. Officer A.

It was later determined S-1 and S-2 are married, and S-1 lives at the residence. S-2 had prior knowledge that S-1 was the person who was attempting to get back into his own residence, in which she lied to Elk Grove PDs dispatchers stating she did not know the person attempting to gain entry into her residence. S-1 was medically cleared at the hospital, and transported to the Sacramento County Main Jail where he was booked without incident. S-2 was cited and released with a promise to appear. NARRATIVE On 09/23/2023 (Saturday) at approximately 0223 hours, (Officer Rodriguez; B21) was on patrol in the City of Elk Grove, which is in Sacramento County. was dressed in my Elk Grove Police Department uniform, and was in a fully marked Elk Grove Police Department patrol vehicle, which was equipped with an in-car camera (ICC). was wearing a body worn camera device affixed to my uniform, and it recorded during this investigation. was dispatched to a suspicious person at (. The text of the call stated an unknown subject was banging on the door, and actively kicking the door. The text of the call also stated the front door was now kicked in to the residence and the reporting party (later identified as Eunice APPLING) was asked twice by dispatch if she knew the subject, and APPLING stated she did not. Due to the text of the call, responded code 3 with my patrol vehicles overhead lights and sirens from the area of Babson Drive and Laguna Boulevard. Based on the text of the call, initially thought the call was responding to could be a burglary in progress. Based on my training and experience, know suspects who burglarize homes are often times in possession of different tools to break into the residence/building/structure. know suspects who are in possession of these tools can use the tools as weapons. 0227 hours: arrived on scene and was also the first officer on scene. decided to wait for an additional unit prior to attempting contact at the call for service address. wanted to wait for an additional unit based upon the text of the call, and how if went alone into the residence, it could pose an immediate danger and officer safety issue. waited at the northwest corner of Livorno Way and Bellaterra Drive while other officers continued to respond to the call. was directly two houses south of the residence. As was waiting for cover, began to hear a female voice screaming very loudly from . It appeared the female was possibly in distress by the sound of her voice being high pitched, and how loud she was. Due to the exigent circumstance, decided to run towards the residence. As was running towards the residence, was thinking there was a potential home invasion, or a potential burglary in progress and a female could possibly be hurt. was in fear and afraid of the possible outcome of what would happen inside of the residence. Although was fearful of what might happen inside of the residence, felt it was necessary to go in due to the female screaming and her potentially being hurt and or even killed. As approached the entry way to the residence, observed the front door to be slightly cracked open. As was approaching the front door, could still hear a female voice screaming from the interior of the residence. unholstered my department issued firearm from its hostler, pushed the front door open with my right foot, and entered the residence. began yelling out loud Elk Grove PD, Elk Grove PD so could identify myself. could still hear yelling and screaming towards the south side of the REPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE / DATE SUPERVISOR SIGNATURE / DATE CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 Sep 25, 2023 10:41 (e- SCOTT WESSEL 10754 Sep 25, 2023 20:08 (e- signature) signature) PRINT NAME PRINT NAME CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 SCOTT WESSEL 10754 Elk Grove Pollce Department Pg 2 of 7 NOTE: St may exist in the RMS. ummartzed report.

Report 23-006300 - Offense/Incident Report Report Cover Sheet Elk Grove Police Department Pg of 3 7 residence. I began to walk towards the south hallway to the residence in an attempt to locate the female who was screaming and the person who had broken into the residence. As I was walking in the hallway, I could hear yelling and screaming still, but I could hear it from the first room to the right (north room) of the hallway. As I looked towards the room, I pointed my firearm towards it as well. I pointed my firearm towards the room because I was unaware if there was going to be a threat and I am trained to assume a potential burglary suspect, or home invasion suspect could be armed with a weapon. I was prepared to use deadly force if needed, especially since I was by myself and did not have a cover unit to have a less-lethal force option. Based on my training and experience, I know suspects who commit felony crimes such as home invasion and burglary are often times armed with guns, knives, and tools that can be used as a deadly weapon. As I pointed my firearm towards the room, I observed APPLING and a male subject (later identified as Leroy DANIELS) in the room standing next to each other. I immediately began to give commands to both DANIELS and APPLING telling them to put their hands up in the air in which they both initially complied. DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side after he originally had them up in the air. I once again raised my voice, telling DANIELS to place his hands up in the air in which he complied with, and raised them. APPLING was directly in front of DANIELS, yelling at me and attempting to gain my attention and focus towards her. I continued to place my focus towards DANIELS since I felt he was the potential suspect for breaking into the residence. I told DANIELS to come towards me and he screamed at me stating, for what man? DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side once again. I yelled at DANIELS once again stating to place his hands up in the air and he responded by yelling at me and saying, I am not going nowhere. Shoot me. Shoot me. At this point I feared DANIELS was going to attempt to hurt me. Based on my training, I know people who want to commit suicide by cop often times want to attempt to kill the police officer, so the police officer in return could use deadly force on them. I feared DANIELS was concealing a weapon due to him placing his hands down by his side after I gave him multiple commands to keep his hands up in the air. When DANIELS told me to shoot him, I responded by saying I was not going to shoot him I continued to attempt to give commands to both subjects, but I was having difficulty due to there being two subjects and I was still alone, and they were both verbally uncooperative. I was able to slightly de-escalate the situation by lowering my voice down and attempting to calm down APPLING and DANIELS. I still had both DANIELS and APPLING at gunpoint at this point and was waiting for backup officers to arrive on scene. When I looked at DANIELS, I noticed he was much larger than me in stature, and appeared he could also be much stronger than me. DANIELS appeared to be approximately 509 and 240lbs, while I am 507 and 150lbs. Officer Crain (B32) arrived on scene to assist me with the call. Officer Crain told APPLING to walk towards him, in which she did, and he began to escort her away from the hallway towards the main living room. Once APPLING was out of the bedroom in which her and DANIELS were originally located in, I told DANIELS to place his hands up and turn around. DANIELS was irate and yelled, For what, bruh yall niggas all in my house. DANIELS approached me quickly as he was saying this. I feared DANIELS was going to attempt to strike me. I holstered my firearm and told DANIELS to turn around. DANIELS responded saying, For what? For what?

I did this because I wanted DANIELS to turn around due to the fact I feared he was going to strike me and because I wanted to detain him in handcuffs. DANIELS willingly turned around for me and placed his own hands behind his back and I did not use any force when I grabbed him on his stomach and upper right arm. As I grabbed DANIELS hands to place them together so I could detain him in handcuffs, DANIELS tensed his body up, and began to forcefully remove his hands from my grip, towards the front of his body. Due to this, I lost grip of DANIELS hands. As I was losing grip of DANIELS hands, he began to yell out loud, Why are you arresting me bruh? Watch out bruh! DANIELS quickly turned towards me and was now looking at me face to face. I feared DANIEL was going to strike me, so I grabbed ahold of his upper part of his arms with both of my hands and pushed him against a wall. At this point Officer Crain attempted to assist me in detaining DANIELS. I observed DANIELS swing and punch Officer Crain with a closed left-fist on the right side of Officer Crains cheek. Based on my knowledge, training, and experience, I know a closed fist punch to the face is very likely to cause great bodily injury. I then observed Officer Crain begin to wrap his arms around DANIELS, but DANIELS was still attempting to strike Officer Crain. I considered the following prior to striking DANIELS: DANIELS was suspected of breaking into the residence, which is a serious crime. DANIELS was unsearched and it was unknown if he was concealing any weapons on his person. DANIELS had already told me to shoot him and I feared he would do an action that would cause me to use deadly force. DANIELS had already resisted uniformed police officers by tensing his body up, and forcefully removing his hands from my grip. DANIELS had swung and punched Officer Crain who is a uniformed police officer, in the face with a closed fist, which is a felony due to him resisting with violence. This attack on Officer Crain could have potentially caused great bodily injury to him. After I considered the above-mentioned information, I delivered a strike to DANIELS face with a closed right fist. It appeared the strike was ineffective, due to DANIELS still attempting to resist and get out of Officer Crains grip. After I struck DANIELS in the face, Officer Crain was able to take DANIELS to the ground. Officer Crain landed on the top of DANIELS, and DANIELS back was originally on the ground, and he was facing up. It appeared to me DANIELS was attempting to overpower Officer Crain by attempting to get out from under him. I quickly moved towards the right side of DANIELS body. DANIELS continued to resist by flailing his body, turning his body towards me, and attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain. Due to DANIELS continuing to resist by attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain, flailing his body, and him already punching Officer Crain in the face, which is a felony crime. I delivered a right elbow strike to the right side of DANIELS face. It appeared the elbow strike was affective this time. DANIELS did not place his hands behind his back right away, but he was no longer attempting to flail his body and get out from under neath Officer Crain. I began to give DANIELS commands telling him I would REPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE / DATE CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 Sep 25, 2023 10:41 (e- signature) PRINT NAME CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 Elk Grove Police Department NOTE: Summarized report.

DANIELS then placed his right arm behind his back, and was able to place his right hand in a handcuff. Officer Crain had control of DANIELS left arm and was able to place his left hand in a handcuff as well, placing him under arrest at 0230 hours. As was initially placing pressure on the back of DANIELS head so he would not attempt to get back up, he began to say he could not breathe. DANIELS kept repeating himself that he could not breathe. DANIELS airway was not obstructed by anything and as soon as DANIELS was in handcuffs, both Officer Crain and got off of his back. After DANIELS was in handcuffs, turned him towards his side so he could be in a better position to breathe since he was stating he could not breathe. At this point observed DANIELS to be bleeding from his face. also observed blood on the carpet where his face near during the altercation. Due to DANIELS suffering facial injuries, requested Fire Personnel to respond to the scene so they could evaluate him. also requested a supervisor to the scene so the use of force would be documented. conducted a pat down of DANIELS person for weapons and did not locate any. sat DANIEL up and he was sitting on his own for a couple seconds. then assisted DANIELS up from the ground and escorted him out of the residence towards my patrol vehicle. conducted a search incident to arrest of DANIELS person and did not locate any illegal items. After searching DANIELS, placed him in the rear of a marked patrol vehicle. While waiting for Fire Personnel to arrive at the scene, began to speak to Officer Crain to ask if he was okay. Officer Crain appeared to be suffering pain already from being punched by DANIELS. Officer Crain was complaining of having a headache, and being dizzy. Furthermore, observed red swelling to the right side of Officer Crains right cheek as we were still on scene. Cosumnes Fire Personnel (CSD) responded to the scene and evaluated DANIELS, and then cleared from the scene. Due to DANIELS visible injuries, DANIELS was going to need to get medically cleared prior to being booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail. Based on DANIELS resisting arrest with violence, and punching Officer Crain in the face causing visible injury, DANIELS was in violation of the following charges: PC 69 - Resisting an executive officer. PC 243(c)(2) - Battery on peace officer. Officer Taylor (B42) assisted me in the investigation. Officer Taylor spoke to APPLING, positively identified her, and obtained her statement. APPLING told Officer Taylor that her and DANIELS are married, and DANIELS lives at i with APPLING. Officer Taylor also found out APPLING purposefully locked DANIELS out of his own residence and had previous knowledge that he was going to attempt to come home. Refer to Officer Taylors supplemental report. Officer Hanna (B31) also spoke to APPLING and obtained a statement from her as well. APPLING told Officer Hanna she knew it was originally her husband, DANIELS, that was attempting to gain entry into his own home. APPLING went on to state that she did not initially tell dispatchers that she knew it was her husband who was attempting to gain entry into his own residence.

As was waiting for cover, began to hear a female voice screaming very loudly from . It appeared the female was possibly in distress by the sound of her voice being high pitched, and how loud she was. Due to the exigent circumstance, decided to run towards the residence. As was running towards the residence, was thinking there was a potential home invasion, or a potential burglary in progress and a female could possibly be hurt. was in fear and afraid of the possible outcome of what would happen inside of the residence. Although was fearful of what might happen inside of the residence, felt it was necessary to go in due to the female screaming and her potentially being hurt and or even killed. As approached the entry way to the residence, observed the front door to be slightly cracked open. As was approaching the front door, could still hear a female voice screaming from the interior of the residence. unholstered my department issued firearm from its hostler, pushed the front door open with my right foot, and entered the residence. began yelling out loud Elk Grove PD, Elk Grove PD so could identify myself. could still hear yelling and screaming towards the south side of the residence. began to walk towards the south hallway to the residence in an attempt to locate the female who was screaming and the person who had broken into the residence. As was walking in the hallway, could hear yelling and screaming still, but could hear it from the first room to the right (north room) of the hallway. As looked towards the room, pointed my firearm towards it as well. pointed my firearm towards the room because was unaware if there was going to be a threat and am trained to assume a potential burglary suspect, or home invasion suspect could be armed with a weapon. was prepared to use deadly force if needed, especially since was by myself and did not have a cover unit to have a less-lethal force option. Based on my training and experience, know suspects who commit felony crimes such as home invasion and burglary are often times armed with guns, knives, and tools that can be used as a deadly weapon. As pointed my firearm towards the room, observed APPLING and a male subject (later identified as Leroy DANIELS) in the room standing next to each other. immediately began to give commands to both DANIELS and APPLING telling them to put their hands up in the air in which they both initially complied. DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side after he originally had them up in the air. once again raised my voice, telling DANIELS to place his hands up in the air in which he complied with, and raised them. APPLING was directly in front of DANIELS, yelling at me and attempting to gain my attention and focus towards her. continued to place my focus towards DANIELS since felt he was the potential suspect for breaking into the residence. told DANIELS to come towards me and he screamed at me stating, for what man? DANIELS then placed his hands down by his side once again. yelled at DANIELS once again stating to place his hands up in the air and he responded by yelling at me and saying, am not going nowhere. Shoot me. Shoot me. At this point feared DANIELS was going to attempt to hurt me. Based on my training, know people who want to commit suicide by cop often times want to attempt to kill the police officer, so the police officer in return could use deadly force on them. feared DANIELS was concealing a weapon due to him placing his hands REPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE / DATE SUPERVISOR SIGNATURE / DATE CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 Sep 25, 2023 10:41 (e- SCOTT WESSEL 10754 Sep 25, 2023 20:08 (e- signature) signature) PRINT NAME PRINT NAME CARLOS RODRIGUEZ 10824 SCOTT WESSEL 10754 Elk Grove Police Department Pg 2 of 10 Matk43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by S.

When DANIELS told me to shoot him, I responded by saying I was not going to shoot him I continued to attempt to give commands to both subjects, but I was having difficulty due to there being two subjects and I was still alone, and they were both verbally uncooperative. I was able to slightly de-escalate the situation by lowering my voice down and attempting to calm down APPLING and DANIELS. I still had both DANIELS and APPLING at gunpoint at this point and was waiting for backup officers to arrive on scene. When I looked at DANIELS, I noticed he was much larger than me in stature, and appeared he could also be much stronger than me. DANIELS appeared to be approximately 509 and 240lbs, while I am 507 and 150lbs. Officer Crain (B32) arrived on scene to assist me with the call. Officer Crain told APPLING to walk towards him, in which she did, and he began to escort her away from the hallway towards the main living room. Once APPLING was out of the bedroom in which her and DANIELS were originally located in, I told DANIELS to place his hands up and turn around. DANIELS was irate and yelled, For what, bruh yall niggas all in my house. DANIELS approached me quickly as he was saying this. I feared DANIELS was going to attempt to strike me. I holstered my firearm and told DANIELS to turn around. DANIELS responded saying, For what? For what? As DANIELS became within arms distance of me, I placed my right hand on his stomach and placed my left hand near his right upper arm area and turned him around so his back was facing me. I did this because I wanted DANIELS to turn around due to the fact I feared he was going to strike me and because I wanted to detain him in handcuffs. DANIELS willingly turned around for me and placed his own hands behind his back and I did not use any force when I grabbed him on his stomach and upper right arm. As I grabbed DANIELS hands to place them together so I could detain him in handcuffs, DANIELS tensed his body up, and began to forcefully remove his hands from my grip, towards the front of his body. Due to this, I lost grip of DANIELS hands. As I was losing grip of DANIELS hands, he began to yell out loud, Why are you arresting me bruh? Watch out bruh! DANIELS quickly turned towards me and was now looking at me face to face. I feared DANIEL was going to strike me, so I grabbed ahold of his upper part of his arms with both of my hands and pushed him against a wall. At this point Officer Crain attempted to assist me in detaining DANIELS. I observed DANIELS swing and punch Officer Crain with a closed left-fist on the right side of Officer Crains cheek. Based on my knowledge, training, and experience, I know a closed fist punch to the face is very likely to cause great bodily injury. I then observed Officer Crain begin to wrap his arms around DANIELS, but DANIELS was still attempting to strike Officer Crain. I considered the following prior to striking DANIELS: DANIELS was suspected of breaking into the residence, which is a serious crime. DANIELS was unsearched and it was unknown if he was concealing any weapons on his person. DANIELS had already told me to shoot him and I feared he would do an action that would cause me to use deadly force.

DANIELS had swung and punched Officer Crain who is a uniformed police officer, in the face with a closed fist, which is a felony due to him resisting with violence. This attack on Officer Crain could have potentially caused great bodily injury to him. After I considered the above-mentioned information, I delivered a strike to DANIELS face with a closed right fist. It appeared the strike was ineffective, due to DANIELS still attempting to resist and get out of Officer Crains grip. After I struck DANIELS in the face, Officer Crain was able to take DANIELS to the ground. Officer Crain landed on the top of DANIELS, and DANIELS back was originally on the ground, and he was facing up. It appeared to me DANIELS was attempting to overpower Officer Crain by attempting to get out from under him. I quickly moved towards the right side of DANIELS body. DANIELS continued to resist by flailing his body, turning his body towards me, and attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain. Due to DANIELS continuing to resist by attempting to get out from underneath Officer Crain, flailing his body, and him already punching Officer Crain in the face, which is a felony crime. I delivered a right elbow strike to the right side of DANIELS face. It appeared the elbow strike was affective this time. DANIELS did not place his hands behind his back right away, but he was no longer attempting to flail his body and get out from under neath Officer Crain. I began to give DANIELS commands telling him I would strike him again if he did not comply. I placed my right elbow behind DANIELS head and put pressure on it to make sure he did not attempt to get up again. DANIELS then placed his right arm behind his back, and I was able to place his right hand in a handcuff. Officer Crain had control of DANIELS left arm and I was able to place his left hand in a handcuff as well, placing him under arrest at 0230 hours. As I was initially placing pressure on the back of DANIELS head so he would not attempt to get back up, he began to say he could not breathe. DANIELS kept repeating himself that he could not breathe. DANIELS airway was not obstructed by anything and as soon as DANIELS was in handcuffs, both Officer Crain and I got off of his back. After DANIELS was in handcuffs, I turned him towards his side so he could be in a better position to breathe since he was stating he could not breathe. At this point I observed DANIELS to be bleeding from his face. I also observed blood on the carpet where his face near during the altercation. Due to DANIELS suffering facial injuries, I requested Fire Personnel to respond to the scene so they could evaluate him. I also requested a supervisor to the scene so the use of force would be documented. I conducted a pat down of DANIELS person for weapons and did not locate any. I sat DANIEL up and he was sitting on his own for a couple seconds. I then assisted DANIELS up from the ground and escorted him out of the residence towards my patrol vehicle. I conducted a search incident to arrest of DANIELS person and did not locate any illegal items. After searching DANIELS, I placed him in the rear of a marked patrol vehicle. While waiting for Fire Personnel to arrive at the scene, I began to speak to Officer Crain to ask if he was okay. Officer Crain appeared to be suffering pain already from being punched by DANIELS. Officer Crain was complaining of having a headache, and being dizzy. Furthermore, I observed red swelling to the right side of Officer Crains right cheek as we were still on scene.

I told that we had the legal right to search the 11 entire property because S01 Ruelas listed the residence as his 12 primary residence for probation, which was subject to search and 13 seizure. I also informed him that S01 Ruelas had warrants, and the 14 deputies saw S01 Ruelas on the property. I told that the 15 deputies gave him a lawful order to come out, and he resisted.

Given S01 Ruelas criminal 12 history, I believed that S01 Ruelas could be lying in wait with a 13 weapon that could cause the searching deputies serious bodily harm or 14 death. 15 16 R01 arrived on the scene and confirmed that S01 Ruelas had no 17 business on the property.

A perimeter of fully marked patrol vehicles and 18 deputies in full Sheriffs Office uniforms were placed to surround 19 the residence. 20 21 After setting the perimeter, I gave several use of force 22 admonishments/warnings pursuant to PC 835 using my patrol vehicles 23 automated announcement system.

S01 Ruelas failed to obey our commands. 5 6 7 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF K9: 8 9 Based on the information I developed on the scene, I determined S01 10 Ruelas was wanted for a felony warrant involving a firearm, had a 11 prior history of assault with a deadly weapon, a gun, and resisting 12 arrest. 13 14 Because S01 Ruelas was hiding in an unknown area, had access to 15 unconventional weapons, was given multiple warnings to surrender 16 peacefully, and was resisting arrest, I believed that S01 Ruelas 17 posed an immediate threat to deputies on the scene and the public. 18 19 Based on the facts mentioned above, I determined that the use of K9 20 Niner was within policy, and the use of K9 Niner would enhance 21 officer safety significantly, increase the likelihood of locating and 22 apprehension of the suspect. The use of K9 Niner would bring this 23 incident to a quick resolution without endangering the public or 24 searching deputies. 25 26 SCENE DESCRIPTION: 27 28 The area to be searched was a single-family home that was currently 29 being renovated and had a detached garage that had been converted 30 into three bedrooms.

None of the keys provided to us worked to 17 open the door. We had to use a breaching ram again to access the main 18 house. Once the door was breached, I gave K9 Niner his search 19 command. 20 21 K9 Niner made entry into the house through the kitchen door and began 22 to search.

We searched the 10 entry backyard and did not locate S01 Ruelas. 11 12 We returned to the area where K9 Niner initially showed a behavior 13 change. Once we returned to this portion of the house, K9 Niner 14 immediately began to search. There was a hole in the floorboard where 15 K9 Niner put his nose in. Niner took a deep breath and immediately 16 began to dig into the floorboard with his front paws. I told the QRF 17 team that S01 Ruelas was underneath the house. 18 19 We began to look for an entry point near where K9 Niner was searching 20 for S01 Ruelas. We could not locate an entry point but advised 21 Sergeant Tracey that we believed S01 Ruelas was under the house. 22 Sergeant Tracey spoke with R01 , who advised there was a crawl 23 space door in the houses bathroom. 24 25 We went to the bathroom and located the plywood that was on the floor. 26 It should be noted that the plywood in the bathroom did not appear to 27 be disturbed. A sitting stool was on top of the wood, which appeared 28 to be flush with all the other boards. I attempted to move one of the 29 plywood boards on the bathrooms east wall. In the left corner, a 30 metal pole made it difficult to lift. I had to move the pole to VICTIM NAME (LAST, FIRST, MIDDLE (FIRM, IF BUSINESS)) State of California OFFICERS NAME C1095-FS Rev 12/95 CASE NO. 23-228-0293E REPORT TYPE 600(a) PC F Willful Injury to a Peace Officer Animal 148(a)(1) PC M Obstruct, Resist, or Delay a Peace ID NUMBER DATE SHIFT/DAYS OFF SUPERVISORS REVIEW ID NUMBER DATE PAGE OF 10 16 08/18/23 2259 Monroe, Tyrone III Tracey, Matthew SSM 2114 08/19/23 042 1819 NARRATIVE FORM SUPPLEMENTAL LOCATION OF ORIGINAL EVENT (IF KNOWN) Meadow Lane / San Jose / 95127 / Residence Office of the Sheriff Santa Clara County 1 remove the board. 2 3 After I removed the plywood board, there was another piece of plywood. 4 To remove this piece of wood, I had to pull it towards me because the 5 wood was tucked under the sheetrock. I would not have been able to 6 remove the plywood without pulling it toward me. 7 8 It should be noted that there was no way for S01 Ruelas to have been 9 able to go underneath both pieces of wood without the assistance of 10 someone else. I believe S01 Ruelas had help getting underneath the 11 floor to the crawl space from an unknown person on the property. The 12 only other people on the property were and . 13 14 Once the crawl space was exposed, I gave additional K9 announcements 15 to S01 Ruelas. I said, Marcus, this is your last and final warning, 16 bud. Im going to send my dog down there, and you will be bit. I did 17 not hear, see, or get a response from S01 Ruelas. Based on S01 18 Ruelas location, it was not feasible to use any other means of 19 lesser force to effect the arrest. Based on the confined space and 20 distance, OC spray would not have been effective. Any impact weapon 21 or hands on restraint would not have been feasible for safe for 22 deputies, as they would have to enter a confined crawl space. 23 Finally, the use of less lethal munition would not have been possible 24 given the fact we did not know S01 Ruelas exact location. 25 26 It was for these reasons above, K9 Niner was the only force option 27 available to deputies in order to overcome S01 Ruelas resistance and 28 affect the arrest. I advised County Communications that we would give 29 several more use of force warnings and K9 announcements at the crawl 30 space to have S01 Ruelas surrender peacefully.

I 12 advised County Communications that we did not get a response and 13 would be deploying K9 Niner into the crawl space. 14 15 I gave K9 Niner his search/apprehension command. 16 17 Deputy Amaya, who was in the kitchen on the south end of the house, 18 asked if K9 Niner was underneath the house. I told him yes. Shortly 19 after, Deputy Amaya advised that K9 Niner located S01 Ruelas and was 20 biting him. I gave K9 Niner his bite command and advised County 21 Communications. 22 23 I walked to Deputy Amayas location in the kitchen and could hear S01 24 Ruelas screaming. I told S01 Ruelas to stop fighting the dog and to 25 bring him to me. I immediately told the QRF team to start looking for 26 an entry point to where we heard S01 Ruelas screaming. 27 28 I walked back to the south end of the house at the entrance to the 29 crawl space and attempted to call K9 Niner back to my location.

I returned to the kitchen area and told S01 Ruelas to stop 2 fighting the dog. I could hear S01 Ruelas screaming. 3 4 At some point, S01 Ruelas stopped screaming. I could no longer hear 5 any movement coming from under the house. Because S01 Ruelas had 6 prior weapons charges and the multiple knives/unconventional weapons 7 observed inside the residence and additional unconventional weapons; 8 I believed that S01 Ruelas may have stabbed K9 Niner or choked him 9 until he was unconscious. 10 11 I immediately went back to the crawl space and called for K9 Niner. I 12 could not hear S01 Ruelas screaming or any movement from both S01 13 Ruelas and K9 Niner. Approximately a minute later, I heard S01 Ruelas 14 start screaming again. I contacted County Communications and 15 immediately requested SJFD to respond to our location with a 16 chainsaw. The QRF team continued to attempt to make a hole in the 17 floor to gain access to S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner. 18 19 Since I could not gain compliance from S01 Ruelas to come to me nor I 20 could not see or get K9 Niner back to my location, Deputy Ashley and 21 I decided to go under the crawl space to get a visual on S01 Ruelas 22 and K9 Niner. Because the crawl space was small, Deputy Ashley and I 23 removed our Sheriffs Office tactical vests. We removed our vest to 24 have a better chance of moving underneath the house. 25 26 It should be mentioned that there was about a one-and-a-half to two 27 feet clearance underneath the house and ground. There was both dry 28 dirt and mud that was underneath the house. The crawl space was dark 29 and had little to no ambient light.

Deputy Ashley and I had to do an army low crawl 2 on our stomachs to move to S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner. 3 4 As I low crawled to S01 Ruelas and Niners location, it was hard to 5 distinguish exactly how far they were. As I closed the distance to K9 6 Niner and S01 Ruelas, there were several times when my duty belt or 7 uniform got stuck on a pipe, wire, or nail. These obstacles made it 8 very difficult for me to move rapidly. 9 10 Using my flashlight, I was able to illuminate S01 Ruelas and K9 Niner. 11 I could see that K9 Niner was biting S01 Ruelass left forearm. S01 12 Ruelas was lying on his left hip. S01 Ruelas was using his right hand 13 to grab the neck area of K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas was using his right 14 hand to choke K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas continued to fight K9 Niner. He 15 moved his right hand from the neck area and placed it on the bridge 16 of K9 Niners nose. S01 Ruelas used his right hand to push K9 Niners 17 face into the mud. It appeared as if S01 Ruelas was trying to 18 suffocate K9 Niner in the mud. 19 20 At this time, I was about fifteen to twenty feet away from S01 Ruelas 21 and K9 Niner. I gave K9 Niner his release command, and K9 Niner 22 immediately released S01 Ruelas left forearm. I recalled Niner to my 23 location, but as K9 Niner was starting to come, S01 Ruelas used both 24 hands to strike K9 Niner in the face. 25 26 K9 Niner immediately re-engaged and re-bit S01 Ruelas left forearm. 27 Before moving up to K9 Niners and S01 Ruelas locations, I told 28 Deputy Ashley to maintain visual on S01 Ruelas because he had not 29 been searched. 30 VICTIM NAME (LAST, FIRST, MIDDLE (FIRM, IF BUSINESS)) State of California OFFICERS NAME C1095-FS Rev 12/95 CASE NO. 23-228-0293E REPORT TYPE 600(a) PC F Willful Injury to a Peace Officer Animal 148(a)(1) PC M Obstruct, Resist, or Delay a Peace ID NUMBER DATE SHIFT/DAYS OFF SUPERVISORS REVIEW ID NUMBER DATE PAGE OF 14 16 08/18/23 2259 Monroe, Tyrone III Tracey, Matthew SSM 2114 08/19/23 042 1819 NARRATIVE FORM SUPPLEMENTAL LOCATION OF ORIGINAL EVENT (IF KNOWN) Meadow Lane / San Jose / 95127 / Residence Office of the Sheriff Santa Clara County 1 Based on the fact that S01 Ruelas continued to pose a threat to K9 2 Niner by fighting him, I crawled to K9 Niner and S01 Ruelas 3 location. I took ahold of K9 Niners collar and gave him his release 4 command. Niner released S01 Ruelas left forearm, and we immediately 5 crawled away from S01 Ruelas. 6 7 Deputy Ashley retreated a couple of feet and was able to keep an eye 8 on S01 Ruelas. Deputy Ashley provided the deputies on the ground 9 floor with updates on S01 Ruelas condition. 10 11 It should be noted that from the south end of the crawl space 12 entry/exit to where S01 Ruelas was located on the north end of the 13 crawl space was approximately 75-80 feet in length. 14 15 I immediately crawled back to the entry/exit point of the crawl space. 16 I was able to exit the crawl space with K9 Niner. Once we were out of 17 the crawl space, I saw that K9 Niner was extremely tired and having 18 difficulty breathing. K9 Niners tongue was fully extended out of his 19 mouth and was hanging to the left/right side of his mouth, causing K9 20 Niner to gasp for air. I immediately went to my patrol vehicle and 21 advised County Communications that I was driving code three to the 22 Emergency Veterinary Hospital 23 24 25 K9 NINERS INJURIES: 26 27 Once we arrived at the Emergency Room, medical staff and 28 Doctor took us back to the medical examination room.

DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if Officer Hernandez provided first aid to Plancarte. Sgt. Carbajal stated Officer Hernandez and Officer Torres, who arrived after the shooting, provided the majority of the first aid to Plancarte. I asked Sgt. Carbajal if when he stated he doubled timed it upon his arrival to the scene, he meant he ran. He stated he did not run but hustled. Sgt. Carbajal stated when he initially got out of his Page 6 of 8 F-24-01578 226 IMPERIAL COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUREAU OF INVESTIGATOIN INVESTIGATION REPORT Christopher Plancarte BOI: 24-01548 patrol unit he started walking to the residence. He stated that as he started hearing the banging he double timed it he jogged. I advised Sgt. Carbajal that earlier he stated he raised his weapon. I asked him if by this he meant his firearm and he stated yes. Sgt. Carbajal stated on arrival he illuminated Plancarte with his handheld flashlight and had already unholstered his gun and had it at the low ready. He stated as he saw Plancarte holding the crowbar he brought his gun up. DAI Peraza then asked Sgt. Carbajal if he saw Officer Hernandez take out his taser or if he was aware if he (Officer Hernandez) had a chance to take his taser out. Sgt. Carbajal stated while on scene he did not see if he took his taser out because Officer Hernandez was behind him. He stated he thought he had taken the taser out and that is the reason he told Officer Hernandez to taze Plancarte. 2024-02-21 21:46:88 -G880 AXON BODY 4 D1A1953W At this point Sgt. Carbajals attorney, Matt Gelfond, stated he had a question regarding this topic. Mr. Gelfond asked Sgt. Carbajal when he told Officer Hernandez to taze Plancarte if he intended that as an order to use the taser and not to shoot. Sgt. Carbajal stated that was not his intention. Sgt. Carbajal stated he wanted to be very clear about this. He stated he believed Officer Hernandez had his taser out and thought that was his only option, so therefore he told Officer Hernandez to taze Plancarte. Sgt. Carbajal stated that was not an order to not shoot. Sgt. Carbajal stated he was glad Officer Hernandez had his gun out and did what he did. Sgt. Carbajal stated that was the only option they had left at that point. Sgt. Carbajal stated that Page 7 of 8 F-24-01578 227 IMPERIAL COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUREAU OF INVESTIGATOIN INVESTIGATION REPORT Christopher Plancarte BOI: 24-01548 Plancarte charging at him within that distance and possibly striking him with the crowbar would have caused him some serious injuries. Sgt. Carbajal stated he credits Officer Hernandez with saving him from getting hit. DAI Peraza asked Sgt. Carbajal if he received any information Plancartes mother was hiding or was in fear when initially responding to the call. Sgt. Carbajal stated he was advised that Plancarte was actively breaking into the residence and his mother was hiding due to fear of being injured. Sgt. Carbajal stated from having prior knowledge of both individuals, he knew Plancarte had the potential to cause great bodily injury to his mother because he had done it in the past.

You progressed through the jail training program and were granted solo officer status in December of 2021. You completed your CO I probationary period and were promoted to a Correctional Officer II in June of 2022. You were assigned light duty in October of 2023, and then placed on administrative assignment in December of 2023. While on administrative assignment, you resigned from the Sheriffs Office on April 22, 2024. As a Correctional Officer you are responsible for a multitude of duties, which also include some of the following: Reading and understanding department policies, rules, instructions, laws and ordinances. Adopting quick, effective, and reasonable courses of actions while considering surrounding hazards and circumstances. Understanding and following written and oral instructions. Exercising good judgement and making sound decisions under a variety of conditions. Adhere to local, state and federal laws and guidelines. Provide for the safety and security of inmates and other jail staff members. Adhere to your oath of office as a Correctional Officer. Conduct yourself in a manner consistent with this agencys mission statement. Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action, re. IA 2023-003 June 20, 2024 Page 2 PERSONNEL FILE REVIEW INVESTIGATION SUMMARY An administrative investigation was conducted by Lieutenant Greene regarding an incident you were involved in on July 4th, 2023. In that investigation you were the suspect of a criminal domestic battery incident that occurred in the City of Grass Valley. During that same investigative period, you were involved in another domestic battery incident that occurred at your residence on July 22, 2023. Your conduct during that incident was also investigated by Lt Greene. In both incidents, it was determined that you knowingly provided false information to law enforcement investigators while at the scene. Lieutenant Greenes investigation also revealed that you knowingly failed to disclose a personal relationship you were having with a convicted felon. The investigation also revealed that Lieutenant Greenes investigation was reviewed by Lieutenant Vingom who SUSTAINED the following policy and law violations: Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action, re.

Members shall familiarize themselves with policies and procedures and are responsible for compliance with each. Members should seek clarification and guidance from supervisors in the event of any perceived ambiguity or uncertainty. Discipline may be initiated for any good cause. It is not mandatory that a specific policy or rule violation be cited to sustain discipline. This policy is not intended to cover every possible type of misconduct. Lexipol Policy 319.5.9(p) (SUSTAINED) Any on-or-off duty conduct which any member knows or reasonably should know is unbecoming a member of this office, is contrary to good order, efficiency, or morale, or tends to reflect unfavorably upon this office or its members. After reviewing Lt Greenes investigation, I concur with Lt Vingoms sustained finding as outlined above. Additionally, after reviewing the investigation, I also find that you are in violation of: Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action, re. IA 2023-003 June 20, 2024 Page 5 ANALYSIS On July 4th, 2023, you were involved in a mutual domestic battery. This incident was investigated by the Grass Valley Police Dept. At that time it was determined that you were told officers that the two of you were engaged and were living together. During that investigation you lied to GVPD Officer Fish about how you sustained your visible injuries. You also lied to officers about your participation in the incident when you told them it was only a verbal argument. You told GVPD Officers your visible injuries were from tripping and falling. It was also noted that you initially identified yourself as an employee of the Sheriffs Office, and you admitted you were under the influence of alcohol. It was also noted that you were heard talking on your phone during the detention, and were recorded telling someone about the incident, and you commented that you were so fired. Your statements were recorded on multiple Grass Valley Police Officers body worn cameras (BWCs). During the Grass Valley Police investigation of the July 4th incident, they learned that a citizen had recorded your altercation on a cell phone, and they obtained a copy of the video recording. In the recording you can been seen walking after your boyfriend on a public sidewalk. As he is walking away from you, he stops and then two of you start arguing again. While he is standing in front of you, you abruptly hit him across his face. He then subsequently grabs you and throws you onto the ground. In watching the video, it was clear the statements you made to the officers regarding how you sustained the injuries to your hands and knees was a lie. It was also very clear that when you told Officer Fish it was only a verbal argument, that too was a lie. In watching the video recording, it was clear that at that moment you were the dominant aggressor. Your recorded comment that evening about being fired and your knowledge about what you had done during the argument provides sufficient motivation for you to lie. On July 4th you had the option of telling the truth, remaining silent, or simply telling the responding officers you did not want to provide a statement. Instead, you chose to knowingly provide false information. As a person who had been a Correctional Officer for over two years, and also having earned a degree in Administration of Justice, you should have known that providing false information is absolutely unacceptable. On July 22nd, 2023, (18 days later) a disturbance at your residence was reported to the Sheriffs Office. You were contacted at your residence and were found inside with an injury to your head and other parts of your body. On the evening of this event, and when questioned later by investigators, you told them that you did not know how you sustained your injuries. You also claimed you didnt not know who caused your injuries. It was later learned that while you were seeking treatment for your injuries, you had sent messages to a coworker naming your boyfriend as the person that was responsible for your injuries. Again, instead of telling the truth, remaining silent, or telling law enforcement officers you did not wish to make a statement, you defaulted to providing a false statement. It is also noted that you were under the influence of alcohol during this incident. Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action, re. IA 2023-003 June 20, 2024 Page 6 CONCLUSION , and knowingly provide false information on multiple occasions, is a violation of state law, Sheriffs Office Policy, Nevada County Policies, and the Local 39 MOU. Sheriffs Office employees have always, and will always, be held to a greater standard. This is further evidenced by the strict Sheriffs Office hiring standards and a pre-employment background process, which is not required by other positions located outside the Sheriffs Office. If you had these types of sustained violations in your background, prior to your employment with the Sheriffs Office, you would not have been selected to be a Correctional Officer. Additionally, had you been convicted in a criminal court of domestic violence, you would not be allowed to be in possession of firearms, which is an essential part of your jobs function. I recognize that Sheriffs Office employees do not have to be perfect, but they must strive to be excellent. A Correctional Officers job is a position of respect and trust. All Sheriffs Office employees are held to the highest standards of behavior. Honesty and credibility are crucial to proper performance of your duties. Dishonesty in matters of public trust is intolerable. Your documented and lengthy pattern of deliberate deception, toward coworkers, supervisors, investigators, and outside law enforcement is irrefutable. Dishonesty is not an isolated act; it is more a continuing trait of character. False statements, misrepresentations and omissions regarding official matters are likely to result in harm to public service, the publics trust in law enforcement and irreparable harm to the reputation of the Sheriffs Office and its employees. Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action, re. IA 2023-003 June 20, 2024 Page 7 RECOMMENDATION: As a result of the investigation and above sustained charges, I am recommending the following discipline to the Sheriff, which I find to be worthy based on all the facts and findings.

"DATE: November 17, 2023 TO: Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto 1414 Natividad Road Salinas, CA 93906 FROM: Monterey County District Attorneys Office SUBJECT: Officer Involved Fatality Date of Incident: August 8, 2023 Location of Incident: 404 Hyland Drive, Salinas, CA Deceased: Anthony Tovar Involved Officers: MCSO Detective David Gonzalez & MCSO Deputy Cristian Pantoja DA Case No.: 23-0005 Sheriff Nieto: The District Attorneys Office has completed its investigation and review of the facts surrounding the officer involved shooting that occurred on August 8, 2023. The scope of this review is narrow. It is not to advise concerning best practices for law enforcement in the field, but rather to determine if any officer committed a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Our review determined the evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt the officers in question committed any crime. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the two officers who fatally shot Anthony Tovar did not have an actual and reasonable belief that Anthony Tovar posed a danger of great bodily injury or death to an officer or civilian when they fatally shot him. FACTS The investigation conducted by the District Attorneys Office included: District Attorney Investigator interviews of the involved officers and civilian witnesses Review of audio and video recordings by law enforcement, including dispatch recordings and 911 audio recordings Review of physical evidence Review of all reports MONTEREY COUNTY OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEANNINE M. PACIONI On August 8, 2023, at around 8:40pm, Anthony Tovar approached a residence and repeatedly knocked on the door. While husband was not present, his wife and two-year old child were home by themselves. Wife did not open the door but became alarmed and contacted husband for assistance. Tovar left before husband returned home. Husband arrived and discussed the events with his wife. He observed Anthony Tovar (25) on his Ring Camera footage and recognized him as a neighbor from across the street. The Ring videos show Tovar knocking on the door at 08:40pm, 08:41pm, and 08:49pm. Husband then went to Tovars address at 407 Hyland Drive and contacted him. Tovar claimed that he had been looking for his dog. Husband left and returned home. Husband estimates that around ten minutes later, Tovar returned to husband and wifes residence. Husband opened the door and stepped outside to speak with Tovar. Tovar pushed passed him and rushed into the house towards wife who was holding her small child. Tovar pulled out a knife. Tovar said that husband had the ability to release Tovars friends from incarceration. Husband begged Tovar to release his family and tried unsuccessfully to take the knife from Tovar. Tovar held a large knife to wifes throat as he forced her, with her child, to the rear bedroom and barricaded all of them inside. Husband frantically called 911 dispatch asking for a law enforcement response at around 9:30pm. MCSO Sergeant Gonzalez, MCSO Deputy Pantoja, MCSO Deputy Ramirez, and MCSO Deputy Perez responded. At 9:33pm, dispatch advised the responding units that the male (Tovar) was inside the residence with a knife and had forced wife and child into the back bedroom at knifepoint. At 9:34pm, Sergeant Gonzalez arrived on scene and was flagged down by husband who told him that a man (Tovar) was inside his residence with a knife and had his wife and child. Tovar had locked the door. Sergeant Gonzalez, Deputy Ramirez, and Deputy Pantoja decided to immediately enter the residence. After entering the residence, they rushed to the locked bedroom door and verbally announced Sheriffs Department. Sergeant Gonzalez kicked the door multiple times and was able to get it open between 12 and 18 inches. Deputy Pantoja was to his left. Deputies yelled repeatedly for Tovar to Open the door! Tovar had placed a dresser in front of the door to act as a barricade. Sergeant Gonzalez looked in the room and saw wife and child crying on the floor of the bedroom. He also saw wife embracing her child. He saw Tovar facing them with a large knife in his right hand. The knife was over twelve inches in length. Tovar was about five feet from the wife and child while Sergeant Gonzalez was five feet away from Tovar. Sergeant Gonzalez pointed his handgun at Tovar and yelled several commands at Tovar to drop the knife! Tovar refused, waived his hand in a go-away motion, and turned his attention back to wife and child. Sergeant Gonzalez estimated the knife to be around 3 feet away from wife and child. Sergeant Gonzalez fired one shot at Tovar hitting him in the torso. Deputy Pantoja fired one shot and Sergeant Gonzalez fired two more shots. Tovar fell to the ground. The knife was removed from his hand, he was handcuffed, first aid was administered, and medical personnel were dispatched. Tovar was pronounced dead on scene. LEGAL STANDARDS The California District Attorneys Association charge filing standard directs prosecutors to assess whether the evidence would warrant conviction by a jury, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The sole purpose of this review is to determine whether any officer was criminally responsible for the death of Anthony Tovar. On August 19, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 392 into law, which changed the law governing the use of deadly force by police officers and went into effect on January 1, 2020. Under PC 835a(c)(1), a peace officer is justified in using deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary . . . to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person. It also allows for the use of deadly force, to apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts. A threat of death or serious bodily injury is imminent when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. (Id. at subsection (e)(2).) The statute states that totality of the circumstances means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force. (Id. at subsection (e)(3).) Under the law, any personincluding a police officercan use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of others if the person reasonably believes the immediate use of deadly force is necessary to defend against an imminent danger of great bodily injury or death. The danger does not need to exist as long as the person reasonably believes the danger exists. Further, a person acting in self-defense or defense of others is not required to retreat. The person is entitled to stand his or her ground or even, if reasonable, to pursue an assailant until the danger of death or bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been achieved by retreating. Police officers can lawfully use deadly force even if from 20/20 hindsight other feasible options may have existed. The situation must be viewed from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene. Officers are forced to make split-second judgmentsin circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolvingabout the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. When a person has a genuine belief using force in self-defense, or defense of others, is immediately necessary, a person is not guilty of a homicide unless the belief in self-defense, or defense of others, was unreasonable at the time. CONCLUSION There is no basis to conclude that Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja had anything but a genuine belief that deadly force was immediately necessary. Because Tovar kidnapped the mother and her two-year-old child at knifepoint, imprisoned them in their rear bedroom behind a barricaded closed door, displayed a deadly weapon, failed to follow the lawful commands of deputies, and given the totality of these unpredictable and extremely dangerous circumstances, the deputies could reasonably believe Tovar was an imminent threat to the lives of his captors. Therefore, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sergeant Gonzalez or Deputy Pantoja committed any crime. The role of the District Attorney is not to evaluate the efficacy of departmental tactics or training, nor of course to consider issues of civil liability. Those processes may have the goal of identifying areas for improvement in future similar encounters; they may take advantage of the benefit of hindsight and information not known to the involved peace officers. The role of the District Attorney in deciding whether to charge officers with a crime requires judging their conduct and actions from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident with the information available in a rapidly evolving high- stress encounter. Consequently, having found there is insufficient evidence to prove any crime beyond a reasonable doubt, no further action by this office is contemplated or warranted. Ryan J.

Decedent Anthony Tovar forced his way into the residence, grabbed a female adult and placed a knife to her neck while the adult female was holding her 2-year-old daughter. After Tovar MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI Rpt. 001 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 2 of 6 barricaded himself and the two victims inside a bedroom, Monterey County Sheriffs Office personnel breached the door and discharged their firearms fatally striking Tovar. NARRATIVE: On 08/08/2023 at approximately 2220 hours, I was alerted that an OIS had occurred at 404 Hyland Dr. in Salinas and I was requested to respond to the scene by District Attorney Investigative Captain (DAIC) J. Ferreria. I arrived on scene at approximately 2310 hours. I was designated the Lead Investigator by DAIC Ferreria. I was assisted by District Attorney Investigators (DAI) Smith, Gomez, and Williams. It should be noted that DAIC Ferreria and DAI Williams left the scene to photograph Monterey County Sheriffs Office (MCSO) personnel involved in the shooting and they conducted a round count of the associated OIS weapons. DAI Smith and I were then directed to obtain a statement from the reporting party, Victim 1. It should be noted that Victim 1 was seated in an MCSO patrol vehicle prior to the interview. It should also be noted that I audio- recorded the interview with Victim 1 with my department-issued digital recorder (Item KH 1). The following is a summary of the interview with Victim 1. SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTIM 1: After exiting the patrol vehicle, DAI Smith and I identified ourselves to Victim 1 and he agreed to speak with us. Victim 1 confirmed he lived at 404 Hyland Dr. with his wife, Victim 2, and their two-year-old daughter, Victim 3. Victim 1 provided verbal consent to search the home regarding our investigation. Victim 1 stated a male adult, later identified as Decedent Tovar, entered his home, proceeded into the kitchen area of the home where he grabbed Victim 2 and Victim 3 and took them into a rear bedroom of the residence utilized by Victim 3. Victim 1 stated Tovar first approached the residence at approximately 2030 hours on 08/08/2023. Victim 1 was not present at the residence but was informed that Tovar was knocking aggressively on the front door and side door of the residence while Victim 2 was inside the residence with Victim 3. Victim 2 did not open the doors. After arriving at the home, Victim 1 did MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI Rpt. 001 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 3 of 6 not see Tovar. However, Victim 1 accessed his Ring camera which was mounted next to the residences front door. After he reviewed the Ring cameras video to see who had been knocking the residences front door earlier on 08/08/2023, Victim 1 said, It seemed like the neighbor. Victim 1 stated he went across the street to attempt to discover why Tovar had been knocking on the door. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar come around the side of a pink residence (407 A Hyland Dr.) behind 407 Hyland Dr. According to Victim 1, Tovar stated he had been looking for his dog at Victim 1s residence earlier in the evening. Victim 1 and Tovar then parted ways. Victim 1 stated Tovar returned to 404 Hyland Dr. and knocked on the front door about 10 minutes after his first encounter with Tovar. Victim 1 opened the door and noted Tovar was acting kind of weird because he wanted to step inside the house. Victim 1 stated he told Tovar they could speak outside the residence. However, Tovar went around Victim 1, entered the residence through the open front door, and approached Victim 2 in the kitchen area of the residence. Victim 2 was holding Victim 3. After grabbing Victim 2 and Victim 3, Tovar brandished a knife. Victim 1 stated that Tovar made several comments including, you have to help me, because I have some friends in prison, and you have power to get them out. Victim 1 stated he pleaded with Tovar to release Victim 2 and Victim 3 and to leave the residence. Victim 1 stated he began struggling with Tovar and unsuccessfully attempted to grab of the knife. Tovar then forced Victim 2 and Victim 3 into the residences rear bedroom and locked the door leaving Victim 1 outside the bedroom. Victim 1 then called law enforcement. Victim 1 confirmed Tovar had the knife prior to entering the residence. Victim 1 stated Tovar made additional comments about friends in prison and that Victim 1 had the power to release these individuals from incarceration. Victim 1 stated he didnt know Tovar but believed Tovar was associated with the pink residence behind 407 Hyland Dr. Victim 1 stated after he called law enforcement, he continued to plead with Tovar to release his family and to not hurt them. Victim 1 exited the residence and spoke with law enforcement when MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI Rpt. 001 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 4 of 6 they arrived. When law enforcement entered his residence, Victim 1 followed but was ordered to leave the residence. Victim 1 confirmed he was inside the home when he heard gunshots. Victim 1 stated he did not hear anything prior to the gunshots. Victim 1 stated Tovar spoke mostly to Victim 1 after entering the home in the kitchen area, mainly concerning the release of Tovars incarcerated friends. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar grab Victim 2 around her shoulders and Tovar had the knife behind Victim 2. Victim 1 stated when Tovar first knocked on the residences front door, Victim 2 contacted Victim 1 to inform him of the situation. Victim 1 arrived at the residence approximately 10 minutes later and accessed his Ring camera system. Victim 1 stated he attempted to speak with Tovar through his Ring camera system but the battery was low and he was unable to communicate with Tovar. DAI Smith and I had no additional questions for Victim 1 and ended the interview at approximately 2335 hours. NARRATIVE: After the interview with Victim 1 was concluded, DAI Smith and I remained at the scene of the OIS. MCSO Forensic Evidence Technician (FET) R. Okaneku arrived and began processing the crime scene. DAI Smith accompanied FET Okaneku while FET Okaneku processed the crime scene. DAI Smith also took digital photographs of the scene. I remained on scene with DAI Smith and FET Okaneku (See reports from FET Okaneku and DAI Smith). I left the scene of the OIS at approximately 0430 hours on 08/09/2023. On 08/09/2023, I assisted DAI Smith with processing several evidence items recovered from the OIS scene (See DAI Smiths report). Later on 08/09/2023, DAI Gomez and I contacted Victim 2 at 17105 El Rancho Way in Salinas. It should be noted that Victim 2 spoke Spanish only. DAI Gomez, who is a certified Spanish speaker with Monterey County, conducted the interview (See DAI Gomezs report). During the course of the interview with Victim 2, DAI Gomez and I were MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI Rpt. 001 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 5 of 6 informed Tovar grabbed Victim 2s pants and attempted to pull them down while Tovar held her inside the bedroom at 404 Hyland Dr. causing her underwear to rip. Victim 2 provided the grey underwear to DAI Gomez. I took two digital photographs (Item KH 3) of the grey underwear before DAI Gomez collected them as evidence (Item LG 01). Item LG 01 was later booked into evidence at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office. DAI Gomez and I were also informed Tovars grey sweatshirt/jacket had not been removed from 404 Hyland Dr. DAI Gomez and I accompanied Victim 1 to 404 Hyland Dr. and I recovered the grey sweatshirt/jacket (Item KH 2) which was located on top of the bed in the rear bedroom where the OIS occurred. I also took three digital photographs of the grey sweatshirt/jacket before I collected the item (Item KH 4). Item KH 2 was later booked into evidence at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office.

Inv. R. Smith Page 2 of 4 SYNOPSIS: On 08/08/2023, an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS) occurred at 404 Hyland Drive in Salinas. Monterey County Sheriffs Office (MCSO) Deputies responded to a call of a man with a knife. Anthony Tovar had forcibly taken a mother and her two-year-old child at knife point into a bedroom and barricaded the door. MCSO Deputies breached the bedroom and observed Tovar with a knife. The deputies discharged their firearms striking Tovar. Tovar did not survive. NARRATIVE: On 08/08/2023 at 2219 hours, I received a request to respond to an OIS that had occurred on the 400 block of Hyland Drive in Salinas, CA. I arrived at the scene at approximately 2236 hours. I contacted Chief District Attorney Investigator, Ryan McGuirk, and District Attorney Investigative Captain, John Ferreria, who directed District Attorney Investigator (DAI), Hunsaker, and I to interview the Reporting Party (RP), Jose De Jesus Valdivia. During the interview, Valdivia gave us verbal consent to enter and search his residence located at 404 Hyland Drive. Please refer to DAI Hunsakers report for a summary of Valdivias interview. Once we obtained consent to enter Valdivias home, DAI Hunsaker and I were tasked with locating and documenting evidence within the residence. We were notified that MCSOs Forensic Evidence Technician (FET), Rebeka Okaneku, was enroute and we would be assisting in processing the scene. Once FET Okaneku arrived, I was tasked with taking digital photographs of the scene which included the residence at 404 Hyland Drive, the evidence located within the residence, and photos of the decedent. After the photographs were taken, we marked each evidence item with yellow numbered placards. I took additional photographs of the evidence items with the placards. I stood by as FET Okaneku took multiple scans of the residence at 404 Hyland Drive. Once the MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT. 002 By: D.A. Inv. R. Smith Page 3 of 4 scans were completed, I collected the following evidence from the residence: Item RS-001, 9mm shell casing WMA P (Placard 3) Item RS-002, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 4) Item RS-003, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 5) Item RS-004, Knife w/ black handle, approximately 300 mm in length (Placard 6) Item RS-005, 9mm shell casing WIN 9mm Luger (Placard 7) It should be noted that placards 1 and 2 were placed next to black latex gloves that were found at the scene. The items were photographed, but the gloves were not taken as evidence. The coroner deputy arrived on scene to examine and prepare the decedents body for transport. When the coroner deputy moved the decedents body and searched his pants pockets, an iPhone, a Mercedes car key, and a DeWalt box cutter were found in the pockets. When the coroner deputy moved the decedents legs a spent projectile (bullet) was found that had been under the decedents boots. I took photographs and collected the items that were found in the decedents pockets as well as the mushroomed projectile (bullet). They were labeled as the following evidence items: Item RS-006, Black iPhone w/ gray case Item RS-007, Mercedes car key w/ gray fob attached. Item RS-008, DeWalt box cutter (yellow/black) Item RS-009, Spent Projectile (mushroomed) The evidence items were labeled, packaged, and placed in an evidence locker at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office for storage. Two hundred and eleven photographs were taken of the scene. I uploaded the photographs into Evidence.com and labeled the folder as evidence item RS-010. Three additional photographs were taken of evidence item RS-004 (Knife) once I was at the office. I photographed the knife alongside a scale to show the length of the knife and the blade. I uploaded those photographs to Evidence.com as item RS-011. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT. 002 By: D.A. Inv. R.

On 08/08/2023 at approximately 2315 hours, I arrived at the scene and was briefed by DAI Captain Ferreria.

I contacted Victim 1 at his parents home, which was located at 17105 El Rancho Way, Salinas CA 93907. Victim 1 signed a consent form (Item LG05) to search his residence. I signed this document as a Witness, and I forwarded it to DAI Kris Hunsaker. Victim 1 also delivered to me four digital videos (Item LG02) from his Ring camera that was installed at the front door of his residence. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 2 of 11 These videos showed Decedent Tovar and his dog outside the victims front door. I also delivered this evidence to DAI Hunsaker. Conversations with Tovars relatives: On August 9, 2023, at approximately 1104 hours, DAI Rachel Maldonado and I visited Tovars home and we spoke to a number of Tovars family members who were gathered there praying. Among the large group were Tovars parents, his sister and her husband. I spoke to these persons in Spanish and I gathered additional information about Tovars mental history and whereabouts the day before. One of the Tovars sisters (Noemí) spoke both English and Spanish. I recorded our conversation using a digital device and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com (Item LG03). I also photographed the Tovars medication and a knife we found at the home, which resembled the knife Tovar used to kidnap the victims. The following is a synopsis of my conversation with Tovars relatives. For complete details, please refer to the audio file. The names of the family members I spoke to were Berta Murillo and Ernesto Tovar (Tovars parents), Noemí Tovar (Tovars sister) and Jorge (Noemí Tovars husband.) Mental Illness: Tovars parents stated that Tovar had lived with them through his whole life and was unemployed at the time of the officer-involved shooting (OIS). Tovar attended North Monterey County High School for approximately two years but did not graduate. There was consensus among the relatives that Tovar suffered from mental illness and was taking some medications but the length of his illness, depending on who spoke, was either three, four or ten years. Tovars parents did not exactly know what Tovars diagnosis was, but Noemí indicated that he suffered from schizophrenia. Ernesto and Berta stated that Tovar was being treated at Natividad Hospital for mental illness and, sometime in the past, he had been housed at psychiatric facilities in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties. The Santa Cruz County stay lasted approximately one week and occurred sometime in 2021. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 3 of 11 Bertha stated that Tovars illness began in adulthood and manifested with hallucinations. Bertha described Tovar talking to invisible persons. Bertha also stated that Tovar didnt sleep and spent all night walking around their home. The relatives stated that Tovar was often profane and verbally abusive towards his parents but he was never violent at home. The relatives also stated that Tovar had been arrested multiple times for various reasons, including mental illness, bad temper, and for entering a neighbors home without permission. Tovars relatives did not know that neighbors name, but they indicated that the neighbor came to Tovars home and told his parents that he would shoot Tovar with a gun if he ever entered his home again. Bertha stated that on one occasion, Tovar called her from the Monterey County Jail and stated that he could see her and Ernesto inside the jail with him. Noemí and Jorge stated that they knew Tovar better than anyone else because Tovar often visited them at their home (1157 Ranchero Drive, Salinas CA 93905) and he spent a lot of time with them. They also stated that Tovar s ex-girlfriend, whose first name was Destiny, was one of their neighbors on Ranchero Drive. Illicit drugs use: Noemí, Bertha, Ernesto and Jorge stated that Tovar used illicit drugs, including cannabis and methamphetamine, which he obtained from friends. They also stated that Tovars mental illness intensified with drug use. Noemí stated that Tovar began using drugs after he completed probation. Noemí also stated that Tovar told her that he was anxious about finishing probation, so he could start using cannabis. Tovars whereabouts preceding the OIS: Jorge stated that one or two days before the OIS, around 0400 hours, Tovar went to Destinys home and climbed on the roof without permission. Jorge learned about this incident from Noemí, who was informed by Destinys father, who saw him on the roof but did not call law enforcement. Destinys father spoke to Jorge about that incident and he was upset. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 4 of 11 On the date of the OIS, Tovar visited Noemí at her home and she became afraid of him because he was acting up. Noemí was unable to explain what she meant by acting up, but she mentioned that Tovar was moving and touching his face. Her description seemed to describe the behavior of someone under the influence of a stimulant. Noemí also stated that Tovar was out of control because he had broken up with Destiny. Tovar was still with Noemí when Jorge got home from work at approximately 1900 hours, although he was outside the home in his car, which he had driven to Noemís home. Jorge described that when he arrived home, Tovar was OK but lacked concentration, which he attributed to the roof climbing incident at Destinys home. Jorge told Tovar that he did not want him at his home anymore because of the trespassing incident at Destinys home. Noemí cried (presumably at the prospect of not having Tovar visit her home again) and Tovar apologized for his behavior and stated that he would not bother Destiny anymore. Tovar left Noemí and Jorges home crying, in his vehicle, after Noemí also told him that she didnt want him at her home due to the ongoing drama with Destiny. She also told him that she feared he would do something to her or her children when Jorge wasnt home. Noemí explained that she feared Tovar because he did not take his medication and he was abusive to her parents. Tovars relatives did not know when Tovar had last slept or for how long before the OIS, but they believed that he had been awake for 24 or 48 hours since the roof climbing incident at Destinys home. Berta stated that sometime during the evening, prior to the OIS, she saw Tovar standing outside her home, talking to a man. The man told Tovar in Spanish, I saw you in the cameras and what were you doing there? Tovar told the man, I went to get the dog. The dog went over there and I went to get him. Tovars relatives described Tovars dog as a white Chihuahua. Ernesto also heard the conversation between Tovar and the man, and he provided a statement that substantiated MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 5 of 11 Berthas narrative. Sometime thereafter, Bertha noticed police vehicles near her home and she went outside and called Tovar but he was nowhere to be seen. Ernesto stated that after speaking to the man, Tovar entered his home through a rear door and went to the kitchen. Berta and Ernesto didnt know where Tovar went thereafter he was in the kitchen. Tovars medications: Inside Tovars home, on a kitchen shelf, I observed multiple medication containers, three of which had labels from the CVS pharmacy located at 110 Laurel Drive, Salinas, CA 93906. The labels indicated that the medications were prescribed to Tovar by doctors K. Routiher or M. Garuba. The label on the first container was dated June 10, 2023, and read 15 mg Mirtazapine tablet and Take 1 tablet by mouth every day at bedtime. The prescription was for 30 tablets and the container held 29 tables labeled 0 8 A which I verified on the drugs.com website as the imprint for Mirtazapine, an antidepressant. The following two images are photographs of this medication: The label on the second container, dated October 21, 2021, indicated a prescription for 60 Buspirone Hydrochloride 15 mg pills. The label read, 1 tab by mouth twice daily. The container held 57 intact tables labeled 5 5 5 TV 1003 and four half- tablets of the same medicine. The drugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the container label. The image below is a photograph of this medication: The label on the third container, dated July 20, 2022, indicated a prescription for 30 Olanzapine 5 mg tablets. The label read, take 1 tablet every day at bedtime. The container held 26 intact tables labeled CL 40. The drugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the container label. The following image is a photograph of this medication: MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 6 of 11 The large number of tablets found in each container, coupled with the date of the prescriptions and instructions, seemed to corroborate Noemís statement about Tovar not taking his medications. Knife found in Tovars kitchen: On a counter, in Tovars kitchen, we found a knife similar to the one Tovar used during the burglary and kidnapping. We did not find a knife set or any other knives. The image below is a photograph of this knife: MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 7 of 11 Conversation with Victim 2: On August 9, 2023, at approximately 1423 hours, DAI Hunsaker and I spoke with Victim 2 at her father-in-laws home. Present during our conversation was her husband, Victim 1. I recorded our conversation using a digital device (Item LG04) and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com. Victim 2 stated that she resided at her home with her daughter (Victim 3) and her husband. On the date of the OIS she was at home with her daughter. Victim 1 arrived home from work at approximately 1500 hours to eat, and he returned to work at approximately 1600 hours. At approximately 2030 hours, someone knocked on her front door, which was closed but unlocked. Victim 2 believed that the person at the door was her husband, so she approached the door, looked through the door glass, and noticed that the person outside was not her husband, but a young man (Tovar) with a small dog. Tovar was wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and a gray or black item over his face. Tovar made eye contact with Victim 2, hand signaled for her to open the door and remained there for five or ten minutes. Victim 2 panicked and did not open the door. Victim 2 took her daughter to her master bedroom, stayed there some time, called Victim 1 and told him that a stranger was knocking at the front door. Victim 1 told Victim 2 that he was coming home and would arrive in ten minutes. Tovar stopped knocking on the front door for approximately three minutes and began knocking on the side door that was located on the homes north side, between the kitchen and Victim 3s room. This door led from the kitchen to the driveway. Victim 2 called Victim 1 a second time and he tried to talk to Tovar via their front door camera, but the device was not working. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that he was driving home and would be there soon. When he arrived, Victim 1 told Victim 2 that, based on what he saw through the MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 8 of 11 front door camera, he believed Tovar was one of their neighbors. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that he was going to go talk to that neighbor (Tovar) to see what he needed or wanted. Victim 1 walked to Tovars home, which was located in an alley perpendicular to the victims street. After speaking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned home and told Victim 2 that Tovar had gone to their home looking for a dog. After talking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned to his residence, and approximately ten minutes later, Tovar returned to the porch of the victims residence, while Victim 1 was taking his work clothes off to get in the shower. Victim 1 went outside and talked to Tovar, leaving his front door ajar. Tovar ran inside the victims residence, stood approximately 10 feet away from the front door and produced a knife, while Victim 1 stood at the door. When Tovar entered the home, Victim 2 was in the kitchen and her daughter was sitting at the kitchen counter, close to the dining room. Tovar told Victim 1 to close the front door and made incoherent statements, demanding that Victim 1 help him get his family members and his daughter out of prison. Victim 1 told Tovar to go outside with him and let his wife and daughter go. At some point, Tovar moved closer to Victim 1 (farther away from the child), so Victim 2 took advantage of this opportunity to run and pick up Victim 3 from the counter area. She held the child in her arms and brought her to the kitchen, behind the counter, near the stove, and away from Tovar. Victim 2 grabbed her cellular telephone to call 911 but Tovar told her not to call the police. While Tovar was making his incoherent demands, Victim 2 attempted to escape with her daughter through the aforementioned kitchen side door. Victim 2 held the child with her left arm against her chest and handled the door knob with her right hand, but she was unable to open it. When Victim 2 was facing the side door and struggling to open it, Tovar approached her, stood behind her, and prevented her escape by wrapping his left arm across her chest and putting his MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 9 of 11 knife, with his right hand, against the right side of her neck. Victim 2 felt the blade against her skin. I asked Victim 2 if she could re-enact this frightening event and she demonstrated Tovars actions by standing behind Victim 1, wrapping her left arm across his chest and placing her right hand against the right side of his neck. When Tovar held Victim 2 and her daughter hostage in the kitchen, Victim 1 had his cellphone in his hands, and Tovar told him not to call the police. Tovar then turned Victim 2 and her daughter around 180 degrees, away from the side door and made them face the kitchen refrigerator. Tovar then turned Victim 2 and her daughter ninety degrees to the left of the refrigerator and pushed them with force, against their will away from the kitchen, towards the childs bedroom, which was located to the east of the kitchen, down a short and narrow hallway. Tovar kidnapped the Victim2 and Victim 3, closed the childs bedroom door behind him and also closed the bedrooms window curtain. Tovar ordered Victim 2 to sit at the foot of the bed, which she did, as she held her daughter close to her chest with both arms. Tovar began pacing along a dresser that was located to the right of the bedroom door, along the bedrooms west wall. Tovar then handed Victim 2 his cellular telephone and told her to dial Victim 1s number. Victim 2 complied and handed the phone back to Tovar, who continued walking around the room. Victim 2 did not know if Tovar was able to talk to Victim 1, but eventually Tovar placed his phone on a dresser and told Victim 2 that nothing was going to happen to her or her daughter. Tovar pulled all the dresser drawers out, looking for a gun and he asked Victim 2 if there was a gun in her house. Victim 2 told him that there were no guns at her home. Sometime thereafter, Victim 2 and Tovar heard sirens, and Tovar told her in Spanish, I told your husband not to call the police, now all of us are going to get fucked. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 10 of 11 Tovar then told Victim Guzmán to put down and let go of her daughter but she refused and continued holding the child with both arms against her chest, while sitting at the foot of the childs bed. Tovar removed his belt from his pants, threw it somewhere and unbuttoned his pants. Tovar, holding his knife in one of his hands, used his other hand to pull down Victim 2s leggings. Tovar grabbed the leggings and pulled them down with force from the waist area two or three times. While describing this horrible ordeal, Victim 2 used her hands to re-enact her and Tovars actions. Victim 2 moved her left arm away from her daughter, continued holding her against her chest with her right arm, and swiftly grabbed the top of her leggings near the area where Tovar was trying to pull them down and she prevented him from taking her clothes off. Victim 2 told Tovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police inside the room and she asked him to not do anything to her. Tovar continued pulling Victim 2s clothing with such force that he ripped her underwear and pulled Victim 2 and her daughter off the bed. Victim 2 remained on the bedroom floor, holding her daughter. While describing the frightening assault, Victim 2 instinctively pulled her leggings down and showed DAI Hunsaker and I the hole in her underwear, which she was still wearing. At the conclusion of the interview, Victim 2 handed me her ripped underwear, which I delivered to DAI Hunsaker for booking at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office (Item LG01). Victim 2 believed that Tovar was going to sexually assault her. She feared for her life and expected Tovar to stab her with the knife at any time because she had already felt the blade against her neck. Victim 2 told Tovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police come inside the room and she asked him to not do anything to her. She also repeatedly yelled at Victim 1 not to let the police enter the room, as Tovar had told her that he did not want law enforcement MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.004 By: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez 40333 Page 11 of 11 involvement. Victim 2 specifically told Tovar, I am telling him (Victim 1) not to let them in, so dont do anything to me, Im pregnant. The deputies who rescued Victim 2 arrived at the barricaded bedroom door when Victim 2 was on the floor, holding her daughter, with Tovar standing above them with his knife. Victim 2 heard the rescuing deputies give commands to Tovar before they entered the bedroom but she did not understand what they said because she did not speak English. When the rescuing deputies forced the bedroom door open, Victim 2 was still on the floor holding her daughter. Tovar stood up between Victim 2 and the deputies and they continued giving commands to Tovar. Victim 2 did not understand the commands, but she believed the deputies ordered Tovar to drop his knife. Sometime thereafter, Victim 2 heard a gun shot and she observed blood and flesh coming out of one of Tovars forearms. Victim 2closed her eyes when she saw Tovars blood hit one of the bedroom walls, and she covered her daughters eyes with her left hand, as she heard two additional shots. EVIDENCE: ITEM NO.

NARRATIVE: On 08/11/2023 at approximately 0940 hours, DAI Torres and I conducted an interview with MCSO Acting Sergeant/Detective David Gonzalez who was involved in the OIS. The interview was conducted at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office in Salinas. Also in attendance was Sgt. Gonzalezs legal counsel, Terry Leoni. It should be noted that I audio-recorded the interview with Sgt. Gonzalez with my department-issued digital recorder (Item KH 5). The following is a summary of my interview with Sgt. Gonzalez. SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH MCSO SERGEANT DAVID GONZALEZ: I confirmed with Sgt. Gonzalez that he had not been ordered, coerced, or compelled to be present for the interview and he had spoken with his attorney prior to the interview. I also informed Sgt.

Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 4 of 10 Magazine Capacity and Loadout 17 rounds. 1 fully loaded magazine inserted into the magazine well with 1 round chambered (18 total rounds). 2 additional fully loaded 17-round magazines on front of the vest After obtaining the information as noted above, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez to describe in detail the incident that occurred on 08/08/2023 at 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was near the west end of Boronda Rd. near Hwy. 183 prior to the OIS. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was informed by dispatch that a male subject had entered a residence with a knife. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he made sure the responding deputies were using their emergency lights and sirens enroute to Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch he was near Hyland Dr. and stated he had not activated his emergency lights and sirens to respond. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was going to stage in the area when he was advised the male subject had a knife and was with the reporting partys (RP) wife and child. Sgt. Gonzales stated he thought this situation was a hostage/rescue kind of ordeal. Sgt. Gonzalez arrived at El Rancho Way and Hyland Dr. and was approached by the RP (Victim 1). Sgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch of his contact with the RP and that the RP had informed Sgt. Gonzalez the suspect was in a rear bedroom with a knife along with the RPs wife and child. Sgt. Gonzalez observed another deputy behind him and told the deputy, Lets go. Were going to make entry into the house. Sgt. Gonzalez entered the residence at 404 Hyland Dr. and was told by the RP the suspect was in the back room and gave permission for Sgt. Gonzalez to kick down the interior bedroom door. Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door once and observed the door had been barricaded by a heavy object. Sgt. Gonzalez stated when he noticed the barricade, That kind of like triggered in me like a different feeling. Like, this is serious and there is a lot of truth to what this guys saying that theres going to be, were going to open the door and were going to be faced with some kind of scenario. Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door harder a second time near the door handle breaking the door panel. Sgt. Gonzalez was able to open the bedroom door approximately 1 1 ½ feet to look inside the bedroom. When Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door, Deputy Cristian Pantoja was MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.005 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 5 of 10 on Sgt. Gonzalezs left side while Deputy Josue Ramirez was behind Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez looked into the bedroom and saw a lady and child, later identified as Victim 2 and Victim 3 respectively, sitting on the floor of the bedroom in the northeast corner. Victim 2 was crying and holding Victim 3. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he observed the suspect, later identified as Decedent Tovar, standing approximately five feet away from the female and child. Tovar was facing toward Sgt. Gonzalez but was holding and pointing a knife at the female and child. It was then requested to take a break in the interview. After the break, Sgt. Gonzalez continued with his statement. Sgt. Gonzalez described the bedroom as a small room. After kicking the bedroom door, Tovar was looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez saw the knife in Tovars hand which Sgt. Gonzalez described as a kitchen knife, 9 inches, he was holding it by the handle, pointing it at the lady and the child. Sgt. Gonzalez gave verbal commands to Tovar to drop the knife. Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning his gaze towards the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez then fired one round at Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez said he had previously drawn his pistol upon entering the home and his pistol was kept at low ready until he encountered Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez recognized the object blocking the bedroom door as a clothes dresser approximately 3 4 feet tall and the dresser did not allow the door to be fully opened. Sgt. Gonzalez also observed a closet behind Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, What was going through my head at that point was if he gets an opportunity, and he lunges at them with the knife, was that he was going to harm the child or the lady, and if he came at us, I would get stabbed or my partner would get stabbed. And so as soon as he turned to look at the lady, thats when I fired my first shot. Sgt. Gonzalez said the shot struck Tovar in the front torso. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar returned to an aggressive stance and Tovar continued to hold the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez ordered Tovar to drop the knife and heard Deputy Pantoja also order Tovar to drop the knife. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.005 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 6 of 10 Sgt. Gonzalez described Tovar as 5 6 to 5 8 with short hair and thin build. After the first shot, Sgt. Gonzalez said Tovar again looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning his gaze toward the female in the room. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he then fired three additional rounds striking Tovar at least twice. Sgt. Gonzalez noticed a spent shell casing in the air and deduced Deputy Pantoja fired his pistol as well. After being struck, Tovar fell to the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez heard someone state that Tovar still had the knife. Another deputy removed the knife from Tovar and Sgt. Gonzalez removed the female and child from the room. Sgt. Gonzalez turned over the female and child to Deputy Perez and Sgt. Gonzalez returned to the bedroom where he observed the knife was on the floor between Tovar and the females location prior to her removal from the room. Sgt. Gonzalez provided his handcuffs to Deputy Ramirez who handcuffed Tovar. First aid was then administered to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez cleared the remainder of the home and cleared medical personnel to enter the residence to continue to administer first aid to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez directed Deputy Perez to separate the female and the RP into separate vehicles. Sgt. Gonzalez assisted in directing the set up of the crime scene and making the appropriate notifications of the OIS to dispatch. Sgt. Gonzalez directed photographs be taken of the crime scene and the victims. Sgt. Gonzalez then returned to MCSO. Sgt. Gonzalez said the RP indicated Tovar was a neighbor and Sgt. Gonzalez could not state if he knew the suspect by sight from any previous encounters. When I asked, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did announce Sheriffs Office after entering the residence. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did not attempt to force the door open further after kicking the door the second time as he and Deputy Pantoja were able to see Tovar through the established opening. Sgt. Gonzalez confirmed Tovar held the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez was not given a description of Tovar prior to encountering Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he ordered Tovar to drop the knife 3 4 times. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.005 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 7 of 10 Sgt. Gonzalez did not believe he had any additional options available regarding his use of force given the circumstances of the call. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, At that point with what we were addressing, we were presented with a deadly force situation where there was no time to react for a Taser because a Taser could be ineffective. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar appeared to be unaffected by the first gunshot. Sgt. Gonzalez said, In my mind, there was no other option. Sgt. Gonzalez explained the use of a Taser had several drawbacks including agitating Tovar causing Tovar to lunge at Sgt. Gonzalez or the female or child. DAI Torres asked Sgt. Gonzales what was going through his mind when he fired the second volley. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar was still looking for a target because the knife was, like hes ready to go, hes looking to see, he looked at me and then he looked at the lady and thats kind of where, and the knife was so close to them where it would take one step, one half second, and he could have injured like whether its fatally or not fatally, and thats kind of where I thought that he was going to take action with the knife. Sgt. Gonzalez clarified take action to mean stabbing the victims. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he constantly addressed Tovar and did not give commands to the other deputies inside the residence. Sgt. Gonzalez also clarified that when Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez, Tovar was scanning for an option to attack and that was the basis for Sgt. Gonzalezs first shot. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the distance between himself and Tovar to be approximately five feet and Tovar was also approximately five feet away from the female and child who were on the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar was standing, holding the knife while scanning and looked like he was thinking about what he was going to do. So if he had lunged at the lady, in my head, I thought we would not be able to shoot because she would be part of the backdrop. I didnt want to give him that opportunity. Whereas if he had lunged at us, we would still have a clear shot. Sgt. Gonzalez stated other than his commands to Tovar to drop the knife, he did not have time to attempt any other forms of de-escalation. Additionally, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did not have time to discuss the use of less than lethal options prior to entering the residence. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.005 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 8 of 10 Sgt. Gonzalez estimated 1 2 minutes elapsed from the time he entered the residence until the shots were fired. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar did not say anything during the encounter. Sgt. Gonzalez stated had there been ample time to retrieve the less than lethal shotgun, it could have been feasible to use. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the call from dispatch, the information he obtained from the RP, and the fact the bedroom door was barricaded, confirmed his belief Tovar was the intruder. Sgt. Gonzalez said the female was seated on the floor and was sheltering the child by holding the child with both arms. While both were crying, neither victim made any comments during the incident. I asked Sgt. Gonzalez what he believed Tovars intent was when he first observed Tovar standing in the room with the knife. Sgt. Gonzalez said, To inflict like serious bodily harm on someone. Sgt. Gonzalez believed Tovar was intent on injuring somebody. Another break in the interview was taken at this time. After this break, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez several follow-up questions. I asked Sgt. Gonzalez to describe the females position on the floor while holding the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female was sitting on the floor with her feet near her buttocks providing shelter for the child. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the child to be approximately 2 3 years old. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the female to be in her mid-20s. The female had her arms wrapped around the child. Sgt. Gonzalez said the female and child were chest-to-chest facing each other. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female appeared to be in fear for her life as she was crying. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he believed the female was in fear of her life because she was crying and she was sheltering the child from Tovar by wrapping her arms around the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he thought Tovar was going to stab either the female or the child with the knife because of the way Tovar was holding the knife and the way Tovar target scanned by looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and then returning his gaze toward the victims attempting to ascertain which target would be the easiest to stab. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the knife was approximately three feet away from the female and her child. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.005 By: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker Page 9 of 10 Based on his training and experience, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez what possibilities existed with a suspect holding a knife three feet away from a potential victim. Sgt. Gonzalez responded, A person could get stabbed. It takes less than a second. Sgt. Gonzalez did not recall Tovar moving during the encounter. DAI Torres asked if the distance between Tovar and the female and child changed during the encounter and Sgt. Gonzalez stated, No. Sgt. Gonzalez stated after the first shot was fired, Tovar maintained the same position and the knife remained approximately three feet away from the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez could not remember if Tovar moved toward the female and child after the first shot was fired. Sgt. Gonzalez had no additional information to provide but said, It was just a very dramatic situation at the time. When I asked Sgt. Gonzalez if he had previously encountered Tovar, he said he recognized Tovars name after reviewing the CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) and he knew Tovar lived in the area. Sgt. Gonzalez said he knew Tovar, but he did not recognize Tovar during the encounter inside 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez said Tovar had previously registered with him as part of Tovars 290 PC status. I had no additional questions for Sgt. Gonzalez and ended the interview at approximately 1045 hours.

Also present during the interview was attorney Terry Leoni (Leoni Law Firm) representing Deputy Pantoja, and District Attorney Investigator (DAI) Kris Hunsaker. The interview was audio recorded (Items TT 1 and TT 2) using my department issued cellular phone. Items TT 1 and TT 2 were later uploaded into digital evidence at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office. Deputy Pantoja confirmed this interview was voluntary, and he was not ordered, coerced, or MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.006 By: D.A. Inv. T. Torres Page 2 of 4 compelled to provide a statement. Deputy Pantoja also had the opportunity to consult with his attorney prior to this interview. Deputy Pantoja was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, and experience. The following is a summary of his responses: Deputy Pantoja said he is employed with the Monterey County Sheriffs Office and is a Deputy in training. Deputy Pantoja has been in the field training program for approximately 2 ½ months. He has been employed with the Sheriffs Office for 4 years and was a jail deputy prior to his current assignment. Deputy Pantoja has attended the basic police academy and does not hold any auxiliary assignments. Deputy Pantoja has not attended any specialized training other than the police academy. On the day of this interview, Deputy Pantoja was 29 years of age, and his current title is Deputy in training. Deputy Pantoja is issued a Glock 17 Pistol that utilizes a 9 mm round. Deputy Pantoja is also assigned a patrol rifle. The rifle is a Colt rifle that fires a .223 round. The pistol and rifle have an added department-issued flashlight attached to them. The pistol has been issued to Deputy Pantoja for approximately 4 years. The rifle has been issued to him for approximately 1 year. Deputy Pantoja does not carry a backup weapon. Deputy Pantoja performs functions checks before every shift on both of his issued firearms. Deputy Pantoja qualified with both firearms the week he started the field training program. On the day of the incident, Deputy Pantoja was wearing a class A uniform which consists of a shirt with Sheriffs Office patches on both sleeves. He was wearing green class A pants and a duty belt. Deputy Pantoja also had a badge on his left chest and a name plate on the right chest. Deputy Pantoja carries two (2) pairs of handcuffs, radio, flashlight, collapsible baton, Glock 17 pistol, taser, OC spray and two (2) pistol magazines on his duty belt. On the day of the incident Deputy Pantoja was in a marked Sheriffs Office patrol car. The vehicle is equipped with emergency lights and siren. The vehicle is not equipped with a camera. Deputy Pantoja said the Monterey County Sheriffs Office does not issue body worn cameras to deputies. Deputy Pantoja went on to recall the events of the day of the incident. Deputy Pantoja said he was dispatched to a call that was a 911 hang up. He was told by dispatch that a caller had said there was someone with a knife and then the call was disconnected. Deputy Pantoja was finishing a traffic stop at the time he was contacted by dispatch. After getting in his vehicle, a location was given on Hyland Drive. Deputy Pantoja activated his emergency lights and siren and responded to the area. While driving to the location, additional information was being provided to Deputy Pantoja. Deputy Pantoja said he was told that a suspect was locked in a room armed with a knife, with a MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.006 By: D.A. Inv. T. Torres Page 3 of 4 female adult and a child. Upon arriving, Deputy Pantoja said he saw Sgt. Gonzalez running towards the residence where the suspect was located. Deputy Pantoja followed Sgt. Gonzalez into the residence. Deputy Pantoja said due to the severity of the information he was provided, he unholstered his firearm. When he entered the residence, Deputy Pantoja saw a male adult in the living room of the house. He ordered the adult to exit which he did. Sgt. Gonzalez went down a hallway inside of the residence to a closed door. Sgt. Gonzalez attempted to open the door, but it was locked. Sgt. Gonzalez told Deputy Pantoja to take a breach position. Deputy Pantoja believed this meant they would kick the door open. Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the door approximately two (2) times. Deputy Pantoja said he began to feel fear because it was unknown what was inside of the room. Deputy Pantoja said he knew someone had a knife and possible hostages inside of the room. Deputy Pantoja said the door appeared to be barricaded and it opened only slightly after being kicked. Deputy Pantoja said he looked inside of the room, and he could see a female adult who appeared to be holding a small child and was in distress. The female was crying as was the child and they were on the bedroom floor. Deputy Pantoja said the female adult appeared to be in fear for her life. Deputy Pantoja said he was holding his firearm in a low ready position and was scanning the room. Deputy Pantoja said he saw a Hispanic male adult holding what appeared to be a kitchen knife in his hand. Deputy Pantoja said he was afraid because he did not know the suspects abilities with the knife. Deputy Pantoja said he began to give the suspect commands such as drop the knife. Deputy Pantoja said he felt afraid for his life as well as the life of the female and child. The suspect was in close proximity to the victims as well as the deputies. Deputy Pantoja said that the suspect, later identified as Anthony Tovar, was not listening to any of the commands the deputies were giving him. Deputy Pantoja yelled at Tovar and said, look at me. Tovar looked at Deputy Pantoja and waived his hand in a motion that Deputy Pantoja took as go away. Tovar was in a bladed stance and holding the knife out in front of himself. Tovar then began to turn away from Deputy Pantoja and Sgt. Gonzalez towards both victims. Deputy Pantoja said he heard approximately three (3) rounds go off from Sgt. Gonzalezs pistol. Tovar flinched and had a physical reaction to the shots. Deputy Pantoja said he believed the shots had struck Tovar. Tovar then turned completely around with his back to the deputies. He faced both the female and the child with the knife still in his hand. The blade of the knife was pointed at both victims. Deputy Pantoja said it was at this time he believed it was Tovars intention to kill both the woman and child. Tovar took a step in the victims direction with the blade of the knife pointed directly at them. Deputy Pantoja estimated Tovar was only a few feet away from the victims at this time. Deputy Pantoja fired a single shot at Tovar. Tovar stopped and showed a flinch or physical MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.006 By: D.A. Inv. T. Torres Page 4 of 4 reaction to the single shot. Tovar then collapsed with the knife still in his hand. Tovar was on the floor motionless. Deputies forced their way in the room and removed the knife from his hand. Deputies rendered basic first aid to Tovar. Fire and AMR were also requested over the radio. Tovar was still breathing and had a pulse during this time. Fire and AMR arrived and took over first aid efforts. At this time Deputy Pantoja was relived from the scene. The interview ended around this time. RECOMMENDATIONS: Forward to District Attorney Investigative Captain J. Ferreria. DAI Ryan J.

Also present during the interview was Attorney Terry Leoni, representing Deputy Ramirez, and Monterey County District Attorney Investigator Justin Bell. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 2 of 8 NARRATIVE: At approximately 1130 hours, I met with Monterey County Sheriffs Office (MCSO) Deputy Josue Ramirez, Attorney Terry Leoni, and Monterey County District Attorney Investigator Justin Bell at the Monterey County District Attorneys Office for an interview. The interview was audio recorded using my department issued digital recorder, and officially began at 1158 hours. It should be noted that due to a break during the interview, there are a total of two audio recordings for this interview. The first interview will be labeled Interview Part 1, and the second, Interview Part 2. Deputy Ramirez stated that this interview was voluntary, and he was not ordered, coerced, or compelled to provide a statement. He also had the opportunity to consult with his attorney prior to this interview. Deputy Ramirez was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, and experience. The following is a summary of his responses: Deputy Ramirez is currently assigned to the patrol division of the Monterey County Sheriffs Office (MCSO), which was the capacity he was working at the time of the Officer Involved Shooting (OIS). Deputy Ramirez was also a breacher on the MCSO SWAT team, a drone operator, and a Field Training Officer (FTO). Deputy Ramirez has been a sworn deputy with MCSO since 2015 (approximately 8 years). He did not work for any other departments prior to MCSO. Deputy Ramirezs badge/CAD number is R8475, and on the day of the OIS his call sign was 1Z3. Deputy Ramirez is 31 years old. Deputy Ramirez has training in the police academy, CPR training, less lethal force options training and arrest and control techniques training. He has not yet attended CIT training for Crisis Intervention or Critical Incidents. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 3 of 8 On the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirez was carrying the following firearm: Glock 17, 9mm Primary Duty Weapon This firearm is department-issued. Deputy Ramirez has had this firearm for over 5 years. The only modifications were a mounted flashlight and grip additions. He last qualified with this weapon in March of 2023, which was also the last time he did a function check. The magazine was loaded to capacity (17 rounds) plus one in the chamber. Deputy Ramirez did not fire his weapon during this incident. At the time of his response to the scene, Deputy Ramirez was dressed in his patrol uniform which consisted of a tan shirt, green BDU uniform pants, a tan outer carrier bearing a badge, name plate, MCSO patches on both sleeves and a patch on the back of the carrier which read Sheriff. Also on the carrier were a flashlight, pepper spray, taser, baton, handcuffs, magazines, and an admin pocket with pens and a notepad. Deputy Ramirez wore a duty belt with only his firearm which was in a drop-down holster attached to his leg. He also wore tactical boots. On the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirezs assigned vehicle was patrol unit 3089. Deputy Ramirez was working in an FTO capacity the evening of the shooting, and he shared this vehicle with his trainee, Deputy Pantoja, who conducted an inspection on the vehicle prior to the start of the shift. Deputy Ramirez believed all the equipment in the vehicle was functioning. The vehicle was equipped with a less lethal shotgun. Deputy Ramirez said the vehicle usually has a WRAP, which is a device used to restrain combative individuals. He did not know if the WRAP was in the trunk that evening since he did not inspect the vehicle. The vehicle was not equipped with any cameras. Deputy Ramirez was then asked to explain in his own words the circumstances surrounding this OIS. The following is a summary of his statement: MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 4 of 8 Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja were on patrol and had just cleared a traffic stop in the city of Salinas at Boronda Road and North Main St. Dispatch advised of a 911 hangup call where a reporting party (RP) reported a man was inside of his residence with a knife. While enroute to the scene, dispatch updated something regarding a mother and a child; however, due to the chaos he, could not recall any more details. Deputy Pantoja was driving, and they headed towards the residence with lights and sirens activated. Deputy Ramirez was the passenger and was talking to Deputy Pantoja making sure they knew where they were going and the fastest route to take. Deputy Ramirez heard Sergeant David Gonzalez advise he had arrived on scene just a few seconds before he and Deputy Pantoja arrived. Deputy Ramirez saw Sergeant Gonzalez speaking with a male outside in front of the house. As they were exiting the vehicle, they saw Sergeant Gonzalez run into the home. Deputy Pantoja immediately ran after Sergeant Gonzalez. Deputy Ramirez immediately followed Deputy Pantoja. As he entered the home, Deputy Ramirez could see Sergeant Gonzalez at the right side of a door in a hallway just past the kitchen. Deputy Pantoja met and stood to the left of that same door. Sergeant Gonzalez began to kick in the door as Deputy Ramirez arrived and stood directly behind Deputy Pantoja. He said the room was at the northeast corner of the home. As the door was kicked open, they noticed it was obstructed by an object, and they could not enter. Deputy Ramirez could not see inside, but he knew Deputy Pantoja and Sergeant Gonzalez were challenging someone as they shouted, Drop the knife. As this was going on, Deputy Ramirez was able to see into the opposite side of the room where a mother and a child were on the floor. He described them as being terrified, trembling, and hugging each other. Deputy Ramirez said commands continued towards the suspect to drop the knife. Deputy Ramirez said he also made commands to drop the knife even though he could not see the suspect. Deputy MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 5 of 8 Ramirez then heard a firearm discharge followed by more commands to drop the knife. Deputy Ramirez heard a firearm discharge again, and then they entered the room. As they entered, Deputy Ramirez could see the suspect on the floor. He also saw the knife. Deputy Ramirez went directly to the mother and child, got them up and escorted them out of the room. Deputy Ramirez returned to the room, handcuffed the suspect, turned him over and began to render medical aid (refer to the audio recording for details on Deputy Ramirezs efforts to treat the suspect). AMR and fire personnel arrived a short time later and took over medical treatment of the suspect. Deputy Ramirez recalled that the officers present during the shooting were Sergeant Gonzalez, Deputy Pantoja, Deputy Perez and himself. I followed up with questions for Deputy Ramirez regarding his mindset during this incident. After hearing initial radio traffic, Deputy Ramirez was in fear for the mother and child. He said he has two daughters himself, so this was terrifying. Deputy Ramirez said he had no prior knowledge of the suspect, and he did not know who the suspect was. Deputy Ramirez said he had no interactions with the suspect prior to the shooting, and the only time he saw him was after deputies entered the room. Prior to the shooting, Deputy Ramirez did not hear or see the suspect. Deputy Ramirez did not recall if any description of the suspect was broadcasted prior to his arrival. Deputy Ramirezs mindset upon arrival was that he needed to be with his sergeant and Deputy Pantoja. He said he did not know if Sergeant Gonzalez heard or saw something, but since he ran into the house by himself, Deputy Pantoja and Deputy Ramirez immediately followed him so they could go in together. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 6 of 8 Deputy Ramirez said there was no plan formulated during this incident, and everything happened so quickly that he could only react to the other officers actions. Deputy Ramirez did not hear communication during the call amongst officers, but he was the last to walk up. As he walked up, he put his hand on the shoulder of Deputy Pantoja in preparation for room entry and to alert Deputy Pantoja that Deputy Ramirez was behind him. This was for tactical purposes as he was trained during SWAT. Deputy Ramirez said that had they been able to enter the room at that point, he would have remained with Deputy Pantoja and provided him direction while dealing with the situation. Due to the circumstances, Deputy Ramirez was not able to do this. Upon arrival at the scene, Deputy Ramirez recalled Sergeant Gonzalez talking to a male he believed to be the reporting party. The male appeared to be in a state of panic. Deputy Ramirez did not hear their exchange. Deputy Ramirez did not recall anyone on scene verbally identify themselves as law enforcement. He said the command of drop the knife was given several times. He said it was more than two. He could not recall any background noise that would obstruct the suspects ability to hear commands. Deputy Ramirez described the layout of the residence as a living room that feeds into the kitchen. The kitchen leads to a hallway where the door to the room is located. This was where the four officers were positioned as they challenged the suspect. From where he was standing in the hallway, Deputy Ramirez estimated he was 10 feet from the mother and child in the room. Deputy Ramirez said he did not discharge his weapon. Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja discharged their weapons. I asked Deputy Ramirez what he thought the suspect was trying to do. He mentioned there were many unknowns regarding the suspect and he was worried he would violently hurt the mother and MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.007 By: D.A. Inv. Maldonado Page 7 of 8 the little girl. He was thinking the worst based on the fact he believed the suspect was a random person in the home, and he was worried of a violent sexual assault. DAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez if any information he received gave him the sense of the type of call this was, specifically to know whether this was a stranger or a domestic violence situation. Deputy Ramirez responded that he could not discern what type of call it was, nor could he know if there were issues with the RP. In his mind, Deputy Ramirez understood this to be a hostage situation based on the information he was given. Deputy Ramirez said that there were no other force options available to deal with the situation. He said that everything happened very quickly and the deputies that shot had to instantly react to what was in front of them. From the time they entered the home until the time of the shots, Deputy Ramirez estimated it was less than a minute. In his mind, when he saw the door was intentionally blocked by the suspect, he believed the suspect was trying to prevent anyone from entering the room. DAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez about the potential danger of a person with a knife, based on his training and experience. He said a knife can cause severe damage or life-threatening injuries. It could take seconds for a person with a knife to severely injure someone. In this situation, there was not enough time to run to a vehicle to get a less lethal option. When they arrived, the immediate instinct was to be with Sergeant Gonzalez, so he was not by himself, and Deputy Ramirez needed to remain with Deputy Pantoja. Deputy Ramirez said that upon opening the door, it opened about a foot. With the layout of the hallway and the amount of space available, they would not have been able to deploy a taser or other less lethal options. Deputy Ramirez did not have a good angle or view to deploy one of these options.

Inv. J. Bell Page 4 of 6 Deputy Perez told me the following in summary: Deputy Perez is normally assigned to coastal patrol, but they were short staffed in Salinas and he volunteered to be reassigned. Deputy Perez was with Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja at a traffic stop at Boronda Rd. and North Main Street. At approximately 2132, hours he received a dispatch call from Monterey County Communications that a male was reporting that a subject was in his house with a knife locked in a room. He said the details were vague at that time. Deputy Perez responded to 404 Hyland Drive with lights and sirens (code 3) behind Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja. He received updates that the reporting party (RP) was asking them to hurry, and said that the subject was in the house with his wife with a knife. Deputy Perez heard Sgt. Gonzales attach himself to the call. They received an update that there was a man with a knife locked in a room with the callers wife and child. Sgt. Gonzales arrived and updated over the radio that he was being flagged down by a male. Deputy Perez arrived on scene shortly after. Deputy Perez saw Deputy Pantoja and Deputy Ramirez running towards the front of the house. Deputy Perez started running after them then paused for a second and thought that he should get the less lethal shotgun out of his trunk. Deputy Perez saw Sgt. Gonzales basically leap into the house and he felt that Sgt. Gonzales had more information because he had arrived first and had spoken to the RP already. Based on Sgt. Gonzales actions and the information he had already received, Deputy Perez felt that the circumstances were so exigent that there was not time to go back and get the less lethal shotgun. Deputy Perez ran towards the house. Deputy Perez said based on the information he had received from dispatch told him that they needed to get into the house quickly. He felt that the subjects were in danger, and he felt that there was just no time. Based on the information he had, he felt that the suspects intention was to harm the woman and child or the responding deputies. When Deputy Perez got to the front door of the residence, he, the RP, and another male were standing just outside the house and he told them to get farther away. When he was inside, he could hear kicking bang bang and the voice of Sgt. Gonzales yelling open the door, open the door When Deputy Perez got to the hallway, he could see Sgt. Gonzales to the right and Deputy MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.008 By: D.A. Inv. J. Bell Page 5 of 6 Pantoja a little bit to the left. Deputy Perez was right behind Deputy Ramirez. He could see that the door was open 1.5 to 2 feet and appeared to be barricaded by a dresser with a mirror attached to it. He could see the deputies trying to push it but it would not move. At that time all he could see through the opening in the door was the dresser blocking the doorway and the back wall of the room. Deputy Perez could not see the mother and child or the suspect in the room. He then heard drop the knife, drop the knife before hearing a bang, and then another bang. He said there was about 5 seconds between the first bang and the second bang. I asked if there was anything going on at the time of the commands to drop the knife that would have prevented someone from hearing the deputies. He said there was not. I asked if he heard any announcements that it was the police or sheriffs department, and he said, no. When Deputy Perez saw that the door was barricaded, Deputy Perez thought that meant that the victims were in danger. That meant that the suspect was not going to come out, and was going to harm the child or the mother, because he had barricaded himself in with them. Deputy Perez turned around and saw the RP behind him and had to tell him to get back outside. Deputy Perez had to help get the door open because it was still barricaded. He saw the suspect on the ground wounded and the mother and child huddled over in a fetal position crying with the mother bear hugging the child. They ended up breaking the door basically in half and climbed over the dresser to get inside the bedroom. Deputy Perez pulled the mother and child out of the room and checked them to make sure they were okay. A little later AMR Ambulance arrived. Deputy Perez put the mother and child into his patrol car, and put the husband into another patrol car. Deputy Perez was told to remain with Deputy Pantoja and they did not discuss anything about the incident. I asked, based on his training and experience, what threat someone with a knife posed. He said a knife could easily kill or seriously injure the victims. I asked if Deputy Perez had the less lethal shotgun upon his arrival into the house, if it could have changed the way the situation was handled. Deputy Perez said he did not think so. MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Case : MCDA 23-0005 Supplement : DAI RPT.008 By: D.A. Inv. J. Bell Page 6 of 6 Firstly, the less lethal shotgun has a standoff distance. Based on the fact that it was such a small room he would not have been able to deploy it safely. Additionally, if the less lethal shotgun was not effective, the suspect could have been angered and then taken out his aggression on the victims while they were barricaded in the room. He said that door was so effectively barricaded that it took the deputies substantial time and effort to get the door open even after the suspect was down. Deputy Perez also described that he could not see the suspect from his position in the hallway, and that he would have needed to get around and in front of the other deputies before he would have an opportunity to use it, and in doing so he would have removed their ability to deploy lethal force and have lethal cover. Deputy Perez said he did not hear any sound from inside the room prior to the shooting, and could not see the suspect. He did not hear any words from the suspect. He did not have any prior knowledge of the suspect or the residence they had entered. Deputy Perez thought that maybe 1 or 2 minutes passed between his arrival on scene and the shooting. He said the whole scene was so dynamic and fast, everything happened in a split- second decision. Deputy Perez never fired his weapon. Deputy Perez said he did not render medical aid to the suspect because he was responsible for the victim and her child. Deputy Perez said he did not think they had any other force options based on how quickly the events transpired. They did not even get a chance to think about using OC or other options. He said OC also would not have been a good option because everyone would have been effected by it in such a confined space, and they would have lost control over the whole situation. He felt that if they had tried a taser, people are aware of how to defeat the taser. He felt if they had tried to tase the suspect and it failed, he would have been angered into action to harm the victim and her child. Deputy Perez said the suspect had the advantage over them the entire time. Based on what Deputy Perez saw once in the room, he understood the suspect was a lunge away from the victims and it would have taken less than a second for him to harm them.

Gavin Wells regarding the Use of Force Review Board Findings following an inquiry into the fatal shooting of Richard Pyorre (age 53) by Deputy Ben Moore on November 16, 2023. have reviewed the accompanying Internal Administrative Investigation report (2023-00014) and the accompanying attachments. The findings of the Deadly Force Review Board were that Deputy Ben Moores actions related to his involvement in a shooting on November 16, 2023 were appropriate and within policy. further found that Deputy Moore was in compliance with applicable training, and that his use of deadly force in this situation was appropriate for the following reasons: Richard Pyorre presented an immediate and severe threat to Deputy Moore at the time force was applied. Richard Pyorre was in immediate possession of a firearm. There were no other reasonable options available to Deputy Moore. Use of impact weapons, electronic control devices, pepper spray, or hands-on techniques were not viable options. Deputy Moore is well trained in use of force issues and techniques. Deputy Moore perceived Richard Pyorre to be an imminent threat to his life. Richard Pyorre presented a great potential for injury to Deputy Moore, other peace officers on scene and to members of the public. There was an immediate need to prevent Richard Pyorre from continuing his activity as well as to stop him from committing a firearm attack on Deputy Moore himself. Deputy Moore delivered deadly force until he no longer perceived Pyorre to be a threat. Deputy Moores ammunition, uniform, and firearm were all in compliance with departmental regulations. Deputy Moore appropriately used his recording devices to memorialize the incident. RECOMMENDATIONS: No disciplinary action regarding Deputy Moores compliance with policies and procedures should be brought against him. With Regards, Rob Howe ez: ge Date: S- Le.

"MERCED COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE Nicole A. Silveira District Attorney June 28, 2024 Merced Police Department Attn: Chief Steven Stanfield 611 W. 22 Street Merced, CA 95340 Re: Officer Wilkins Officer Involved Shooting October 26, 2023 Chief Stanfield, The Merced County District Attorneys Office has conducted an investigation into the fatal officer- involved shooting of Gilbert Garibay by Officers Wilkins on October 26, 2023. The criminal investigation was led by the Merced Police Department. The District Attorneys Office Bureau of Investigations conducted a review of the incident. The purpose of the investigation by the District Attorneys Office is to determine if any violation of criminal law may have occurred on the part of either officer. A prosecutor should file criminal charges only if the prosecutor reasonably believes that the charges are supported by probable cause, that admissible evidence will be sufficient to support conviction beyond reasonable doubt, and that the decision to the charge is in the interest of justice. Possible criminal charges against Officer Wilkins are: Possible criminal charges against an officer involved in a shooting include murder (Penal Code Section 187); manslaughter (Penal Code Section 192); assault with a deadly weapon (Penal Code Section 245); and assault by a police officer (Penal Code Section 149). In order to convict an officer of any of these charges, however, it would be necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no legal justifications existed for the officers actions. (People v. Adrian (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 335, 340-342.) Justifications for an officers actions are set forth in Penal Code Sections 196, 197 and 835a. Pursuant to Penal Code Section 835a, peace officers may use deadly force, when necessary, in defense of human life. In decision should be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, rather than the benefit of hindsight. The totality of the circumstances should include considering situations in which officers are forced to make quick judgments about using force. Penal Code Section 835a further provides a peace officer is justified in using deadly force when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of the 550 W. Main Street Merced, CA 95340 Telephone (209) 385-7381 Fax (209) 725-3669 Victim Witness Telephone (209) 385-7385 445 I Street Los Banos, CA 95635 Telephone (209) 710-6070 Fax (209) 724-4066 circumstances such force is necessary to defend against imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. In this case, Officer Wilkins responded to a dispatch call surrounding a subject who was possibly suicidal. Officer Kusomo also arrived on scene at some point to assist. While on scene, Officer Wilkins stated over the radio that he had one at gunpoint, has a knife wont put it down. He then stated, responsible walking towards us with knife. Body camera footage depicts Garibay opening a folding knife and Officer Wilkins then drawing his firearm. He warned Garibay to drop the knife. Investigators estimated Garibay was approximately 10 feet from Officer Wilkins at this point. Garibay then advanced toward Officer Wilkins while Officer Wilkins advised him to drop the knife seven times. Garibay told the officers shoot me three separate times. Both officers continued to tell Garibay to drop the knife. Officer Wilkins retreated as Garibay advanced with the knife as he continued to give commands including youre going to shot, stop. During the entirety of the contact, it is estimated that Garibay advanced towards Officer Kusomo and Officer Wilkins over 78 feet as they retreated and gave commands. After giving multiple commands and the subject failing to comply, Officer Wilkins fired four rounds from his firearm. Officer Kusomo fired three rounds. Garibay died from gunshot wounds. Based on Investigator Nelsons training and experience, individuals with sharp weapons can present fatal danger to others within 21 feet of others. Here, Officer Wilkins gave multiple commands and gave Garibay several opportunities to comply before resorting to deadly force as Garibay closed the distance between himself and Officer Wilkins. Although Officer Wilkins did not give a statement specifically stating what his state of mind was at the time of using deadly force, circumstantial evidence along with Investigator Nelsons opinion support the conclusion that Officer Wilkins reasonably believed it was necessary to defend against imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Officer Wilkins was justified in using deadly force in this case. Respectfully submitted, Nicole A.

In this case, Officer Kusomo was on scene with Officer Wilkins and Garibay.

Body camera footage depicts Garibay opening a folding knife and Officer Wilkins then drawing his firearm. He warned Garibay to drop the knife. Investigators estimated Garibay was approximately 10 feet from Officer Wilkins at this point. Officer Kusomo was in close proximity to both Garibay and Officer Wilkins. Body camera footage depicts Garibay advancing towards Kusomo and stating, shoot me. Garibay then advanced toward Officer Wilkins while Officer Wilkins advised him to drop the knife seven times. Officer Kusomo told Garibay to drop it five times and drop the knife two additional times. Garibay told the officers shoot me three separate times.

J stayed on the phone with the dispatcher and made a u-turn so he could keep an eye on the subject. Jj was still on the phone with the dispatcher when MPD Officers Brandon Wilkins and Saggalih Kusumo arrived in the 3200 block of M Street. Jj was north of the officers and observed the subject through his side mirror. When J rolled down his window, he could hear the officers giving orders to the subject, which included, Drop the knife. ggg used his cell phone to record the incident. The subject in the median was later identified as Gilbert Garibay. Garibay walked directly in front of Officer Wilkins patrol vehicle as Officer Wilkins arrived. Garibay was seen holding an object in his right hand. Garibay then used his left hand to open the folding knife he was holding in his right hand. Officer Wilkins unholstered his duty weapon and pointed it at Garibay. Officer Wilkins used a loud voice and said, drop the knife now. Officer Kusumo also told Garibay to drop the knife. Officer Wilkins announced over the radio that he had one person at gunpoint and that person had a knife. Both officers retreated by walking backwards. Garibay stated, Shoot me. Garibay continued to hold the open knife in his right hand and advanced towards the officers. Several more announcements were made by both officers for Garibay to, Drop the knife. Garibay said shoot me two more times and then began to walk faster towards Officer Wilkins. According to the measurements provided by MPDs Crime Scene Response Teams diagram Officer Wilkins walked backwards approximately 78 feet and 10 inches. This measurement was taken from the left front tire of Officer Wilkins patrol unit and where Garibays knife was found. Officer Wilkins then announced, Youre going to get shot, stop. Officer Wilkins fired his duty weapon four times at Garibay, and Officer Kusumo fired her duty weapon three times at Garibay. Medical aid was provided to Garibay immediately following the shooting by Officer Wilkins. Responding officers also assisted in providing medical aid and relayed over the radio that it was safe for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to come to their location. Medical aid continued until Garibay was pronounced deceased at 0109 hours, by the Riggs Paramedic Jeffrey Kuhne. DISPATCH LOG / RECORDINGS I reviewed the 911 call made by gg and the radio traffic provided by MPD. The following is a short summary of the 911 call to MPD Dispatch. gg told the dispatcher, I just had a guy like try to kill himself in front of my truck. Jj explained that the guy was in the median and he dove in front of my truck. J said he had to swerve around him. Jy described the area as M Street, near Jack in the Box. JJ described the subject as wearing green pants and a black sweatshirt. GE also added that the subject was wearing glasses and a tan hat. The dispatcher told gj that an officer would meet with him. The dispatcher broadcast over the radio there was a subject with 913 thoughts. This is the code for suicide. The dispatcher relayed that the reporting party was going to be at M Street and Collins Drive. The following is a summary of the radio communication between Office Wilkins and MPD Dispatch. Officer Wilkins radioed that he was out with both parties. Officer Wilkins radioed, approximately 25 seconds later, one at gunpoint, has a knife wont put it down. Nine seconds after that transmission, Page 3 Page 4 Officer Wilkins radioed responsible walking towards us with knife and just 12 seconds after that radio transmission, Officer Wilkins radioed shots fired, shots fired. CRIME SCENE Merced Police Departments Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) completed a crime scene diagram, took multiple photos, and completed a report of the scene.

One bullet strike was found at 559 Collins Drive, 2 (this is an upstairs apartment). The casings and bullet fragments were logged into evidence by CSRT. BODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo were wearing Body Worn Cameras (BWC) during this incident. The following is a sequence of still photos taken from Officer Wilkins BWC. The time of this still photo is 01:00:01. Garibay walked towards Officer Wilkins as Officer Wilkins stepped out of his patrol vehicle. Garibay had the knife in his right hand. Page 9 Garibay opening the folding knife. Within one second of the last still photo, Officer Wilkins drew his firearm. Officer Wilkins told Garibay to Drop that, drop that knife now. In my estimation Garibay was within 10 feet of Officer Wilkins at this point. Page 10 At 01:00:14, Garibay said, Shoot me and advanced towards Officer Kusumo. Garibay changed his advancement towards Officer Wilkins. By this time Officer Wilkins had ordered Garibay to drop the knife seven times. Officer Kusumo told Garibay to drop it five times and drop the knife two additional times. Page 11 Garibay told the officers Shoot me three separate times. Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo continued to tell Garibay to drop the knife. At 01:00:44, Officer Wilkins announced, Youre going to get shot, stop. In my assessment Garibay was steadily walking faster towards Officer Wilkins and an eminent threat to stab Officer Wilkins. Page 12 At 01:00:46, Garibay fell to the ground after Officer Wilkins fired four shots and Officer Kusumo fired three shots in Garibays direction. When Officer Wilkins moved Garibay to provide medical aid, the handle of the knife could be seen. The following is a sequence of still photos taken from Officer Kusumos BWC. It should be noted that Detective Rocha found an approximate two second discrepancy between Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumos time stamp on their respective Axon BWCs. Officer Wilkins BWC time stamp was two seconds faster than Officer Kusumos. 23 -80056604 Lert ee re The time of this still photo is 01:00:25 and is the beginning of Officer Kusumos video.

INVESTIGATOR NELSONS TRAINING AND EXPERENCE WITH EDGED WEAPONS Throughout my 25 years as a law enforcement officer, I have received ongoing firearm and defensive tactic training. It has been consistently taught to me that edged weapon attacks are highly fatal. In addition, a subject with an edged weapon has the ability to close the distance of 21 feet before I can identify the threat, make a decision and react properly with deadly force. Page 17 APPLICABLE LAW California Penal Code, Section 196 details the circumstances when a public officers intentional killing of another is justified. CALCRIM 507, a jury instruction, uses plain language to describe the elements of Penal Code, Section 196, stating: . . . if he killed someone while acting as a public officer. . . such a killing is justified, and therefore not unlawful, if: 1. The person who killed another was a public officer; 2. The killing was committed while overcoming actual resistance to some legal process or while performing any other legal duty; 3. The killing was necessary to accomplish one of those lawful purposes; AND 4. The public officer had probable cause to believe that the decedent posed a threat of death or great bodily injury, either to the public officer or to others or that the decedent had committed (insert applicable crime here) and that crime threatened the public officer or others with death or great bodily injury. A person has probable cause to believe that someone poses a threat of death or great bodily injury when facts known to the person would persuade someone of reasonable caution that the other person is going to cause death or great bodily injury to another. Great bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury. It is an injury that is greater than minor or moderate harm. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not justified. If the People have not met this burden, a jury must find the public officer not guilty of murder or manslaughter. (As was intended by the authors, the language above was modified or removed to correspond to the circumstances of this case. Changes are shown in brackets. The full text of CALCRIM 507 is attached in the appendix.) A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed a public offense or is a danger to others may use reasonable force to detain or arrest the person, to prevent the persons escape, or to overcome the persons resistance. (California Penal Code, Section 835a; CALCRIM 2670.) An officer who detains or arrests a person does not need to retreat or stop his or her efforts if the person resists or threatens resistance. Moreover, using reasonable force does not make the officer an aggressor or cause him or her to lose the right to self-defense. (California Penal Code, Section 835a.) The person being detained or arrested has a duty to permit himself or herself to be detained, and the person must refrain from using force or any weapon to resist arrest. (People v. Allen (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 981, 985; California Penal Code, Section 834a; CALCRIM 2670, 2671, 2672.) A peace officer may use deadly force under circumstances where it is reasonably necessary for self- defense or defense of another. (California Penal Code, Sections, 196 and 197.) California law permits the use of deadly force if the person actually and reasonable believed he/she or another was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. It is the reasonable appearance of danger to the officer and his/her Page 18 honest belief in that danger which is controlling. If an officer actually believes that deadly force is necessary and that belief is reasonable under the circumstances, the officers actions are lawful even if it is later determined that the danger did not actually exist. (CALCRIM 505, 507; People v. Toledo (1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 577; People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.) Further, the officer need not prove that he/she had the right to use deadly force. Rather, it is the prosecution which must prove that the officer did not have that right.",emails-memorandum-correspondence,emails-memorandum-correspondence,True
